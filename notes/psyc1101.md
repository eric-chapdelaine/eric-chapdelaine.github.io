# Introduction and Overview

What is psychology? A science
* 300 BC: Aristotle thinks about thinking (introspection)
* 1653 "study of the soul" (Philipp Melanchthon)
* Predict the behaviors of and explain the motivations of and manipulate the
  emotions of people

Humanist Psychology
* Maslow: need to help humans

Psychology's Biggest Question:
* Nature vs. Nurture
    * Biology vs. Environment and experience.
    * Nurture works on what nature endows

Levels of Analysis
* In order to answer a question, you must first decide which level you want to
  answer it on
    * The big 3: Biological, psychological, social-cultural

Apple is a *human factors* company
* When they make a feature, it is very easy to use which makes them a very
  valuable company

# The Scientific Method

There are three types of lies: lies, damned lies, and *statistics*.

Ex. You need to run trials before you can put your drug out there. And it needs to be statistically better than what's already out there.

## Statistics

On the air you can say a extreme lies (ex. "mile high pie"), but you can't say a lie that sounds reasonable (ex. "8-inch-high-pie)--unless it's true.

How things are presented make a huge difference.

Every time you simplify a finding, you sacrifice completeness
* Ex: Averages

### Averages
* Mean - Typically the arithmetic average.
* Median - 50th percentile, or middle number of a rank-ordered sequence
* Mode - Most commonly occurring value
* The Middle - The mean of the high and low end

### Bias

Bias in data means that a result will tend to be reported as either too high or too low.

The bell curve or *normal distribution curve* represents a population.

The mean and median can often not tell the same story: for example, if all of us have 5 dollars and one person walks in with 500 dollars and steals our money, the median went down and the mean went up.

### Variability

Variability is great is sports, but bad everywhere else. Averages derived from scores with low variability are more reliable than averages based on scores with high variability.

### Standard Deviations

Means and Standard Deviations are descriptives. They tell us about data.

When we calculate test statistics to decide if a difference is *meaningful*, we want to be sure that it is
* If we are 95% sure, then we say a difference is "significant"

The *central limit theorem* states that the distribution of the estimates of the *mean* drawn from any population -- even one that is not normally distributed -- will be approximately normally distributed if the sample is sufficiently large.
* We want the values to fall outside of the lines in a distributions like these so that we are 95% sure 

Saying that an effect is significant doesn't mean that the effect is large, only that we are certain that it exists.

The SD of the means that we would get if we kept sampling the population is called the standard error of of the mean (SEM).

The SEM decreases with the square root of sample size ($n$):

$SEM = \frac{SD}{\sqrt{n}}$ 

Thus, we get diminishing returns with increasing sample size.
* More is better, but every 1 added is less and less important

The population of your sample is very important

### Correlations

Correlations are defined by a coefficient called Pearson's Product Moment and abbreviated "r".
* $r$ can range from -1 to 1.
* The closer the magnitude of $r$ is to +/- 1, the more it is correlated

The square of $r$ is often taken as a measure of the proportion of the variability of one parameter.
* Ex. If the $r$ value of IQ and academic achievement is 0.5, then IQ makes up about 25% of your academic achievement 

Correlation is the *only* thing to imply causation.

If an off correlation holds up over repeated studies, however, it *is* probably causal somehow.

Correlations are really sensitive to outliers

### Hindsight Bias

Hindsight bias is the phenomenon of seeing an event that already occurred as being easily predictable when, in fact, before it happened, it was not.
* This is a major issue in law: Amazon is the only Web vendor with "one click shopping." Obvious?
    * It is *now*

We also have a tendency to be overconfident. We must be:
* Curious,
* Skeptical, and
* Humble.

### Case Studies

Studying an individual or group to study a population of a whole.

For example, if a blind person is missing a part of their brain, then we can hypothesize that that part of the brain is responsible for seeing.

The plural of anecdotes is *not* results--but it is data.


### Experiments

In an experiment we typically have
* A control group, and
* One or more experimental groups 

Independent Variables - The factor that is manipulated
Dependent Variables - The factor that in (possibly) influenced by the Independent Variable

There are always bias; the best of us cannot help but insert our values into the interpretation.

### Ethics

We prioritize human health and happiness over that of animals. But what is the right balance?

The APA recommends that scientists:
* Obtain informed consent,
* Make efforts to protect their subjects from pain or discomfort
* Keep identifying information confidential, and
* Debrief.

# Psychobiology

There is a biological reason for everything psychological.

In order to understand a system, you need a more complicated system. Therefore, it's hard to understand the brain with the brain.

"I think therefore I am"
* Meaning if we are in the Matrix, you'd still exist

The fundamental unit is the nervous system with the cell the fundamental unit of that.

## Neuron
**Neuron**: A nerve cell. A cell with a synapse.

We say a cell is hyper polarized if it is *more negative* than usual

We say a cell is depolarized if it is *less* negative than usual*

The language of neurons is both electric and biological.

### Synapse

The neurotransmitter acts like a "key" with special chemical "locks" called receptors.

### Neurotransmitters

Acetylcholine (ACh)
* Handles movement

Morphine
* Alleviating pain and inducing euphoria

Synthetic Neurotransmitter
* Creating artificial "keys" to unlock the "lock"
* Either creates an exact key OR close enough to jam the lock so the real key can't get in

## Nervous System

Central Nervous System (CNS)
* The brain and the spine
Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)
* Everything else

Nerves are bundles of axons

Nerves
* Sensory
    * Carry messages from the sense organs to the brain or spine for processing
* Motor
* Carry signals from the CNS to the muscles and organs
* Interneurons
    * These are all those neurons between sensory and motor neurons (most neurons are interneurons)

### PNS: Somatic Nervous System
The somatic nervous system  in the concious part -- you have concious control (ex. Limbs).

### ANS: Automatic Nervous System
Unconscious functions (ex. Heart rate). However, this is a fuzzy line.

### CNS: Central Nervous System
"You" are your brain 

"Ascending" signals are signals to the brain
"Descending" signals are from the brain

### The Endocrine System
It "sets the tone"

Signals set by the endocrine system linger in the blood explains why feelings linger.

</div>


### The Old Brain
Instinctual impulses. We call it the old brain because it is present in (most) other animals.
* Breathing
* Heart-rate
* etc.

### The Limbic System 
* The amygdala (Very important)
    * Handles fear and emotions
* The hypothalamus - reward center of the brain. Activated, rats will pass out pushing a lever to stimulate the hypothalamus.
    * Thirst 
    * Hunger
    * and Sexual behavior

## The New Brain
Handles conciousness


### The Cerebellum ("The Little Brain")
Handles motor functions

### The Cerebral Cortex

**Frontal Lobe**: Planning and thinking through actions

We know what certain parts of the brain by case studying of people who are missing that part of the brain.

For example, the frontal lobe is connected with planning and emotions.

Motor cortex, sensory cortex

**Association Areas**:

More than $\frac{3}{4}$th of the cortex is *not* one of those regions that receives direct sensory input or sends motor output. These areas are called *association areas*.


**Visual and Auditory Cortex**: Handles audio and visuals in a very organized manner


### Brain-Computer Interfaces
By using EEG, fMRI, or implanted electrodes, we can "eavesdrop" into what's going on inside a living person's brain.

---
The first writing assignment is due next Wednesday (February 3rd)
* Which movie is funnier, *Airplane!* or *The Holy Grail?*.
* Imagine a research project that you could conduct yourself
* What is your operational definition of funny
    * For this purpose of this project, this means funny

1. Explain the problem to be addressed
2. Operationalize the variables under study, and
3. Outline the statistical approach that will be used to test the hypothesis.

### Plasticity

Describes the ability of the CNS to change as a result of insult or experience 

Plasticity underpins the observation that the blind may appear to have keener hearing than the sighted.

Similarly, if a blind person reads braille with one finger, the part of the brain used for vision is not used for that finger.

Conclusion:
* Use it or lose it
    * If you don't use a certain part of your brain, it will take on a different purpose

### The Divided Brain

**The Right Brain**: is more so the animal brain -- not very good at logic. Ex. Artistic creativity.

**The Left Brain**: More logic focused

Our brain is split and information is processed through the **corpus callosum**.

People with severed corpus callosum's are given a screen to look at that says "HE*ART".
* When asked to speak (left side processes) the word, they said "ART"
* When asked to point at the word (right side process), they pointed at "HE"

### Language 

Reading, writing, speaking, singing. All are language skills.

**Broca's Area**
* In the frontal lobe, is critical for speech generation.

**Wernicke's Area**
In the temporal lobe, is essential for generation cohererent speech 

**The Angular Gyrus**:
* In the parietal lobe, is requires for the processing of auditory input

# The Mind

What is the mind?

What is consciousness? 
* It's not fixed -- you can become unconscious 

The most important question in psychology and biology is *why*?

We have *two minds*:
* the one we are aware on, and
* the one we are not

Our conciousness does not make decisions. Our ideas are merely rationalized *post hoc*. 

D.F. Lost her concious sight, but could still see -- she moved out of the way of objects.
