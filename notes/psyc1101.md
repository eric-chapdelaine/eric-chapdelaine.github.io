# Introduction and Overview

What is psychology? A science
* 300 BC: Aristotle thinks about thinking (introspection)
* 1653 "study of the soul" (Philipp Melanchthon)
* Predict the behaviors of and explain the motivations of and manipulate the
  emotions of people

Humanist Psychology
* Maslow: need to help humans

Psychology's Biggest Question:
* Nature vs. Nurture
    * Biology vs. Environment and experience.
    * Nurture works on what nature endows

Levels of Analysis
* In order to answer a question, you must first decide which level you want to
  answer it on
    * The big 3: Biological, psychological, social-cultural

Apple is a *human factors* company
* When they make a feature, it is very easy to use which makes them a very
  valuable company

# The Scientific Method

There are three types of lies: lies, damned lies, and *statistics*.

Ex. You need to run trials before you can put your drug out there. And it needs to be statistically better than what's already out there.

## Statistics

On the air you can say a extreme lies (ex. "mile high pie"), but you can't say a lie that sounds reasonable (ex. "8-inch-high-pie)--unless it's true.

How things are presented make a huge difference.

Every time you simplify a finding, you sacrifice completeness
* Ex: Averages

### Averages
* Mean - Typically the arithmetic average.
* Median - 50th percentile, or middle number of a rank-ordered sequence
* Mode - Most commonly occurring value
* The Middle - The mean of the high and low end

### Bias

Bias in data means that a result will tend to be reported as either too high or too low.

The bell curve or *normal distribution curve* represents a population.

The mean and median can often not tell the same story: for example, if all of us have 5 dollars and one person walks in with 500 dollars and steals our money, the median went down and the mean went up.

### Variability

Variability is great is sports, but bad everywhere else. Averages derived from scores with low variability are more reliable than averages based on scores with high variability.

### Standard Deviations

Means and Standard Deviations are descriptives. They tell us about data.

When we calculate test statistics to decide if a difference is *meaningful*, we want to be sure that it is
* If we are 95% sure, then we say a difference is "significant"

The *central limit theorem* states that the distribution of the estimates of the *mean* drawn from any population -- even one that is not normally distributed -- will be approximately normally distributed if the sample is sufficiently large.
* We want the values to fall outside of the lines in a distributions like these so that we are 95% sure 

Saying that an effect is significant doesn't mean that the effect is large, only that we are certain that it exists.

The SD of the means that we would get if we kept sampling the population is called the standard error of of the mean (SEM).

The SEM decreases with the square root of sample size ($n$):

$SEM = \frac{SD}{\sqrt{n}}$ 

Thus, we get diminishing returns with increasing sample size.
* More is better, but every 1 added is less and less important

The population of your sample is very important

### Correlations

Correlations are defined by a coefficient called Pearson's Product Moment and abbreviated "r".
* $r$ can range from -1 to 1.
* The closer the magnitude of $r$ is to +/- 1, the more it is correlated

The square of $r$ is often taken as a measure of the proportion of the variability of one parameter.
* Ex. If the $r$ value of IQ and academic achievement is 0.5, then IQ makes up about 25% of your academic achievement 

Correlation is the *only* thing to imply causation.

If an off correlation holds up over repeated studies, however, it *is* probably causal somehow.

Correlations are really sensitive to outliers

### Hindsight Bias

Hindsight bias is the phenomenon of seeing an event that already occurred as being easily predictable when, in fact, before it happened, it was not.
* This is a major issue in law: Amazon is the only Web vendor with "one click shopping." Obvious?
    * It is *now*

We also have a tendency to be overconfident. We must be:
* Curious,
* Skeptical, and
* Humble.

### Case Studies

Studying an individual or group to study a population of a whole.

For example, if a blind person is missing a part of their brain, then we can hypothesize that that part of the brain is responsible for seeing.

The plural of anecdotes is *not* results--but it is data.


### Experiments

In an experiment we typically have
* A control group, and
* One or more experimental groups 

Independent Variables - The factor that is manipulated
Dependent Variables - The factor that in (possibly) influenced by the Independent Variable

There are always bias; the best of us cannot help but insert our values into the interpretation.

### Ethics

We prioritize human health and happiness over that of animals. But what is the right balance?

The APA recommends that scientists:
* Obtain informed consent,
* Make efforts to protect their subjects from pain or discomfort
* Keep identifying information confidential, and
* Debrief.

# Psychobiology

There is a biological reason for everything psychological.

In order to understand a system, you need a more complicated system. Therefore, it's hard to understand the brain with the brain.

"I think therefore I am"
* Meaning if we are in the Matrix, you'd still exist

The fundamental unit is the nervous system with the cell the fundamental unit of that.

## Neuron
**Neuron**: A nerve cell. A cell with a synapse.

We say a cell is hyper polarized if it is *more negative* than usual

We say a cell is depolarized if it is *less* negative than usual*

The language of neurons is both electric and biological.

### Synapse

The neurotransmitter acts like a "key" with special chemical "locks" called receptors.

### Neurotransmitters

Acetylcholine (ACh)
* Handles movement

Morphine
* Alleviating pain and inducing euphoria

Synthetic Neurotransmitter
* Creating artificial "keys" to unlock the "lock"
* Either creates an exact key OR close enough to jam the lock so the real key can't get in

## Nervous System

Central Nervous System (CNS)
* The brain and the spine
Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)
* Everything else

Nerves are bundles of axons

Nerves
* Sensory
    * Carry messages from the sense organs to the brain or spine for processing
* Motor
* Carry signals from the CNS to the muscles and organs
* Interneurons
    * These are all those neurons between sensory and motor neurons (most neurons are interneurons)

### PNS: Somatic Nervous System
The somatic nervous system  in the concious part -- you have concious control (ex. Limbs).

### ANS: Automatic Nervous System
Unconscious functions (ex. Heart rate). However, this is a fuzzy line.

### CNS: Central Nervous System
"You" are your brain 

"Ascending" signals are signals to the brain
"Descending" signals are from the brain 

<div style='width: 90%' class='ui rounded images'>
<img class='ui image' src='/notes/psyc1101/lec3-fig1.png'>
</div>

### The Endocrine System
It "sets the tone"

Signals set by the endocrine system linger in the blood explains why feelings linger.

<div style='width: 90%' class='ui rounded images'>
<img class='ui image' src='/notes/psyc1101/lec3-fig2.png'>
</div>

## The Brain


<div style='width: 90%' class='ui rounded images'>
<img class='ui image' src='/notes/psyc1101/lec3-fig3.png'>
</div>


### The Old Brain
Instinctual impulses. We call it the old brain because it is present in (most) other animals.
* Breathing
* Heart-rate
* etc.

### The Limbic System 
* The amygdala (Very important)
    * Handles fear and emotions
* The hypothalamus - reward center of the brain. Activated, rats will pass out pushing a lever to stimulate the hypothalamus.
    * Thirst 
    * Hunger
    * and Sexual behavior

## The New Brain
Handles conciousness


### The Cerebellum ("The Little Brain")
Handles motor functions

### The Cerebral Cortex

**Frontal Lobe**: Planning and thinking through actions

We know what certain parts of the brain by case studying of people who are missing that part of the brain.

For example, the frontal lobe is connected with planning and emotions.

Motor cortex, sensory cortex

**Association Areas**:

More than $\frac{3}{4}$th of the cortex is *not* one of those regions that receives direct sensory input or sends motor output. These areas are called *association areas*.


**Visual and Auditory Cortex**: Handles audio and visuals in a very organized manner


### Brain-Computer Interfaces
By using EEG, fMRI, or implanted electrodes, we can "eavesdrop" into what's going on inside a living person's brain.

---
The first writing assignment is due next Wednesday (February 3rd)
* Which movie is funnier, *Airplane!* or *The Holy Grail?*.
* Imagine a research project that you could conduct yourself
* What is your operational definition of funny
    * For this purpose of this project, this means funny

1. Explain the problem to be addressed
2. Operationalize the variables under study, and
3. Outline the statistical approach that will be used to test the hypothesis.

---

### Plasticity

Describes the ability of the CNS to change as a result of insult or experience 

Plasticity underpins the observation that the blind may appear to have keener hearing than the sighted.

Similarly, if a blind person reads braille with one finger, the part of the brain used for vision is not used for that finger.

Conclusion:
* Use it or lose it
    * If you don't use a certain part of your brain, it will take on a different purpose

### The Divided Brain

**The Right Brain**: is more so the animal brain -- not very good at logic. Ex. Artistic creativity.

**The Left Brain**: More logic focused

Our brain is split and information is processed through the **corpus callosum**.

People with severed corpus callosum's are given a screen to look at that says "HE*ART".
* When asked to speak (left side processes) the word, they said "ART"
* When asked to point at the word (right side process), they pointed at "HE"

### Language 

Reading, writing, speaking, singing. All are language skills.

**Broca's Area**
* In the frontal lobe, is critical for speech generation.

**Wernicke's Area**
In the temporal lobe, is essential for generation cohererent speech 

**The Angular Gyrus**:
* In the parietal lobe, is requires for the processing of auditory input

## The Nervous System II

People with isolated damage to the brain can 'see' without being aware of the sight.
* You can respond to things without being *aware* of them

**Parallel processing**: What your brain handles on its own (ex. Going for a walk.)

**Serial Processing**: Your concious thought (ex. 5+12)

Attention -- serial processing -- is selective. You can only focus on one thing at once.
* It's hard to split your attention
* Ex. With gorilla basketball experiment

### Cognitive Blindness 
The gorilla basketball experiment and distracted driving are cases of *inattentional* blindness.

**Change bias**: The idea that the brain can miss seemingly obvious, big changes.
* Switching experiment instructors and people didn't notice that they were two different people

### Circadian Rhythm and Sleep

The SCN is our 'biological clock' that regulates your alertness and sleep

Before the age of 20, we are night owls

After 20, we are early birds

Falling asleep is actually an instantaneous process -- there is no 'half asleep'.

Here are the stages of sleep:

<div style='width: 90%' class='ui rounded images'>
<img class='ui image' src='/notes/psyc1101/lec5-fig1.png'>
</div>

Here are the stages throughout the night:

<div style='width: 90%' class='ui rounded images'>
<img class='ui image' src='/notes/psyc1101/lec5-fig2.png'>
</div>

The light bulb messes up our *circadian rhythm*.

Throughout our lives, our sleep changes:

<div style='width: 90%' class='ui rounded images'>
<img class='ui image' src='/notes/psyc1101/lec5-fig3.png'>
</div>

**REM rebound**:

After sleep depravation, people have more REM sleep once they get sleep, indicating that it is the most important stage.

**Sleep Loss**

20% of high school students say that they fall asleep in class at least once a week

~60% of high school and college students are sleep deprived

Risks of lack of sleep:
* Shorter life
* Higher blood pressure
* Less stress
* Etc.

You also perform better driving.

**Insomnia**: Is the *persistent* difficulty with falling or staying asleep. Drugs and alcohol is bad to self-medicate. Instead try:
* Exercise,
* Cutting back on caffeine, 
* Turning down the lights
* Practicing relaxation 

**Apnea**: A period, up to a minute, where sleepers fail to breathe. They are then "jerked" awake by snoring.

**Narcolepsy**: The sufferer is overcome by overwhelming sleepiness. They often occur at very inopportune times, such as after exerting oneself by
* Laughing
* Playing sports
* Etc.

**Night Terrors**: Disease of children. Young children will awaken, talk incoherently and experience rapid heart and breathing rates. Typically, they do not remember anything in the morning. They are not in REM sleep which means that they are not dreams.

**Sleepwalking/talking**: Sleepwalkers are also usually children. It is genetic. They are also not typically acting out their dreams.

### Dreams

We now know when someone is dreaming (during REM sleep).

* After a trauma, people tend to have nightmares. 
* Musicians dream frequently of music. 

We are not concious when we dream, our unconscious minds are still running.

People are still aware of things that are going on:
* Spraying someone with mist will often cause them to dream about water

Dreams do *not* act as metaphors for our life's problems.

We often rehearse the things that we did throughout the day in our dreams.

The amygdala determines and holds what is emotionally important.

Dreams are the result of our brain's 'housekeeping' at night.

## Psychoactive Drugs

People who drink more, *can* drink more. This is because people develop **tolerance**.

As tolerance increase, people increase their dose (to get the same result). As you increase your tolerance, you experience withdraws. 

**Dependence**:

There are two different dependencies: physical and psychological. As the name implies, physical dependencies cause physical discomfort.

We may be dependent on many things:
* Smartphones
* Exercise
* Sex
* Work
* etc.

But these aren't *addictions*. We shouldn't overstate or understate the dangers of drugs. Addictive substances aren't necessarily going to ruin you. People also overcome addiction very frequently. There are more ex-smokers than smoking.

But addiction is still the leading cause of accidental death in the US.

There are three different types of drugs:
* Depressants
* Stimulants 
* Hallucinogenics 

**Depressants**:

Most common depressant is alcohol. The first thing to go is your frontal lobe -- effects of reasoning. Slows down your body -- slows down the fight-or-flight.

You forget what happens when you are drunk. When you are drunk, you can't have REM sleep and therefore you can't store things into your long-term memories. Drinking itself isn't bad, but drinking *can* be dangerous if done unsafely.

Opioids:

Ex: opium, herion, and morphine

If you build a dependence, your body stops making its own.

**Stimulants**:
* Stay awake
* etc.

Caffeine ranks as an #1 in the stimulant category. Withdraw includes headaches.

Meth:

Stopping using meth, you get strong withdrawl symptoms.

Nicotine:

Kills a lot of people per year -- a holocaust worth of people at its peak.

More addictive than heroin or cocaine.

Cocaine:

"Quick high"
* The euphoria lasts about 15 minutes
* By 20 minutes, the user becomes agitated.

It blocks the reuptake of dopamine so it stays in the synapse.

Ecstasy: 

Very deadly

**Hallucinogens**:

LSD:

Distorts perceptions and evokes sensory images in the absence of sensory input.

Marijuana:

People often don't get high on the first hit.

# The Mind

What is the mind?

What is consciousness? 
* It's not fixed -- you can become unconscious 

The most important question in psychology and biology is *why*?

We have *two minds*:
* the one we are aware on, and
* the one we are not

Our conciousness does not make decisions. Our ideas are merely rationalized *post hoc*. 

D.F. Lost her concious sight, but could still see -- she moved out of the way of objects.

# Nature vs. Nurture

The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost
* What does the data say about the choices we make?

## Are Our Genes Our Fate?

People are mostly the same across the world
* We are very similar genetically

20,000 coding genes in our DNA

Most of our DNA is *dark*.

But to what extent to these differences change who we are?

A single nucleotide (A, C, T, or G) can be lost, added, or replaced which is called *mutation*.

We haven't identified most of what individuals genes do.

The function of genes can change.

Epigenetic phenomena can alter which genes are or are not expressed.

We can't experiment differing genes on humans so we study **twins** and **adoption**.

We study identical twins who grow up in different environments. And fraternal twins in the same household. We then can get all four of the possibilities to study nature vs. nurture.

We don't have random grouping in these studies! Identical twins most of the time don't have *exactly* the same genes.

Identical twins are, however, very alike. Are our genes our fate? *Yes -- well sort-of*.

Siblings are only slightly more alike than two kids from the same neighborhood.

Adopted children have more personality traits from their biological parents then their adopted parents.

If this is true, what traits are most heritable? 
* Temperament
    * Children who are shy will likely be introverted as teens
    * Emotionally intense preschoolers are most emotionally intense at college students
* Addiction
    * Both environment and genes play a role

What *aren't* environment:
* Personality is both nature and nurture.

Nurture acts on what nature endows. "Nature *via* nurture".

What things are nurture:
* Value systems
    * Political and religious attitudes
* Social interactions
    * Personal manners
    * How charitable you are 
* Education
    * Nurture can control the quality of school you attend
    * However, its the genes that control the quantity 

<5% of all differences among humans arise from population group differences.

>95% of genetic variation exists within populations.

Because we are similar genes, we therefore have similar personalities. These have been *evolutionary conserved*. We haven't changed all that much from the first humans. Modern humans are the same:
* Fear of snakes and heights
* We share a universal moral code
* Less likely to murder our biological children 

## Gender and Sex Differences

For women, passing on their genes is a literal "labor of love".
* Women have small number of children but focus on quality

Men have this option, but also have the option to have a lot of children and don't have to care about them.

These lead to fundamental differences in the thought of sex between men and women.

Women prefer potential "dads".

Men prefer peak fertility (around the age of 20).

Men want sex more than women; is this biology or social norms?
* Both

Men tend to be more
* Dominant 
* Directive

Women tend to be more
* More pluralist
* Supportive

These differences start in the playground
* Boys play in large groups with a goal
* Girls play in a small groups and tend to imitate adult social relationships

Men enjoy working on tasks together

Women tend to enjoy exploring relationships and use conversation to do this

Women do most of the housework, shopping, childcare

Women are the emotional strength in the family

There are differences in the brain, too.
* The part of the brain that handles verbal fluency are thinker in women
* The part of the cortex involved in spacial perception is thinker in men

Males have two X chromosome (one from mother and father).

Females have an X chromosome from their mother and a Y chromosome from their father.

The brains of both genders differ in utero. 

## Parenting and Personality

The principle of the brain: "use it or lose it".

Parents control what their kids, in large part, do with their daily lives.

Enriched environments makes rats more adventurous and vice versa.

Parents *do* matter. By reinforcing positive and negative behaviors, they can exploit the brain's plasticity to "widen" some paths and "narrow" some others.
* The effects of parents are only important at the margins.

Your peer group determine your personality more than your parents.
* Accents most resemble your peers, not your parents.

Parents, however, determine your value system.

Things that aren't in the parents' control:
* Level of education attained,
* Earning power,
* Intelligence,
* etc.

Bad parenting has been blamed for a lot of mental diseases, however, this isn't true.

Culture obviously impacts parenting

Parents in individualist cultures teach:
* Be yourself

Parents in collectivist cultures teach:
* Respect your elders

## Culture and Personality

Language has helped us our preform other animals.

A feature of culture is how rapidly they are able to change.

Cultures differ in how they value the individual vs how they value the group.

The United States is primarily individualist.
* We are culturally free

We value:
* Freedom
* Independence, and
* Individuality
* Privacy

Cons:
* Greater reports of loneliness 
* More divorce
* More stress
* More suicide

Asian and African countries are primarily collectivists.

Members of these cultures tend to:
* Lost their feeling of self when cut off from a specific culture
* Get value from their groups
* Fitting in is really important

# Development

**Exam Review**:
What is *my* definition of a neuron?
* Synapses

Split brain patient is shown a dog on the left and a boy on the right.

What will they say?
* Boy

What will they point to?
* Dog with left hand

### NUpath Assignment II

The advent of social media and the rise of women as economic and political forces have led to increased scrutiny of power dynamics in professional, interpersonal relationships.

Relationships between employees and students is not forbidden unless there is a power dynamic.

Do you agree with this policy? (150 words)
* Use a human cognitive development argument 

## Parental Development

<details>
  <summary>
  What is a fertilized egg called?
  </summary>
  
  zygote
</details>

Gestation begins about 10 days after conception and lasts for ~37 weeks.
* We typically call term 40 weeks

<details open="">
  <summary>
  Where does the placenta from from?
  </summary>
  
  Zygote
</details>

Alcohol and pregnancy
* Can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome
* Symptoms are male proportioned head
* The fetus can like the smell of alcohol

What do new-borns know?
* They aren't truly blank slates
    * We know how to suck
* They prefer voices over other noises
* Stare at faces

Right after birth
* Learn mother's smell

First few months of life
* Learn a whole array of things
* The association areas of cortex develop
* New nerve fibers between regions supporting language and agility begin to proliferate (lasting into puberty)
* At puberty, we engage in a pruning process

Babies go through the same developmental stages of motor development
* Rolling over
* Keeping themselves sitting
* Sitting up by themselves
* Crawling
* Walking

First memories appear at about 3.5 

In contrast, memories from age 4+ can be sharp and vivid.

Tied a string to a mobile and it took the baby 10 minutes to learn that kicking makes it move. And they keep that knowledge.

Some part of you still remembers people that you don't consciously remember

Jean Piaget is the most famous child developmental psychologist.
* Certain number of stages (hard and fast).

He proposed that during development our brain builds mental frameworks (schemas) into which we place objects and ideas as we encounter them.
* Example: schema of dog gets refined as you grow

Accommodation - not all furry things are dogs

Assimilation - dogs range from big to small

We can't ask babies question so we use:

Preferential looking
* babies will look towards novel things that interest them
* babies will look longer at novel things that interest them

Object permanence 
* Objects exist even when they aren't obverses
* Starts to form in about 3 months


Principles of Objects
* Objects can't pass through other object
* They don't change directions
* they don't fall up
Won't surprise less than 3 month olds (but will an adult).

To a pre operational Mind:
* The glass that's taller *always* has more liquid in it
* 7 year old passes the test
* A couple years younger fail the test

Three-year-olds can look at a diagram of a room and see where a toy is and find it in a real room

2.5-year-old cannot find it in the real room

Preoperational minds cannot comprehend the existence of other minds. 
* Egocentric

Theory of mind - understanding that other people have different minds

**Autism**
* We consider it a
* Heritable
    * if a identical twin has it, 70% chance that the other does too

High IQ highly functional persons with Autism are said to have a special syndrome, called Asperger.
* Some don't get diagnoses until adulthood

Usually diagnosed during the preoperational stage when they fail to:
* Make normal progression with language
* Engage social
* Show an active imagination 

**Concrete Operational Stage**
* At around 6-7, Piaget said that children could comprehend conversation
* Understanding basic laws of physics and reasoning

**Formal Operational**
* At puberty (~12) our reasoning becomes more abstract

These stages are fuzzy and are more continuous

Children are not just little grown ups. They don't have the mental capacity to intentionally upset you.

Language is critical to progression through these stages.
* Allows us to generate schemas

Eight months is when infants cry when held by strangers
* Development of anxiety towards strangers

Physical contact with humans is important and without, we develop life-long attachment issues

Dr. Mary Ainu worth - strange situation experiments

* Babies with secure attachment 
    * Play and explore new environments
* Babies with insecure attachment
    * Showed fear

Is it the parenting style the difference or the child?

100 six-to-nine-month-old difficult were randomly assigned to either
* Sensitive responding trailing
* or nothing

At 1 year
* 68% of infants in the former displayed behavior showed secure attachment


What's important, the milk or the contact?
* Secure attachment is a product of contact rather than nursing

Securely attached children
* More trust in their adulthood
* Happier parents in the future

The reverse is also true
* More aggressive
* Fearful
* Having difficulty forming relationships

If you are neglected as a child, you have a higher likelihood of neglecting their old children.

### Parenting
Divided into styles into three group
* Authoritarian
    * Strict rules are imposed and unquestioned obedience demand
* Permissive
    * Few demands are made or punishments enforced
* Authoritative
    * Demanding, but responsive
        * That is, while rules are imposed, questioning is encouraged discussion is possible 
(or just neglectful)

Which is the best? For adolescence, probably authoritative.o

The frontal lobe is one of the last part of the brain that reaches maturity.

The limbic system is fully developed in adolescence

Adolescence 
* Impulsive
* Emotional
* Reckless
* Wracked with hormones

They aren't stupid. They just lack the planning and foresight that comes with a fully developed frontal lobe.

NUpath Assignment II due Thursday

Kohlberg's latter of moral development?
* <9: Preconvential morality (avoiding punishment)
* 9-Adolescence: conventional morality (based on social norms)
* Adolescence+: Post conventional modality (social norms may be wrong)

(Don't seem to be consistent with more collectivist cultures)

Engagement of adolescents with empathy activity is very important
* Increased grades
* Better self-image

In collectivist societies, they have a better self-image and know what they want to do "when they grow up".

Positive parent relationships indicate friend relationships which is really important.
* Friend relationships change in adolescence

**Birth Order**
* First
    * Parents are more engaged and focused
* Second
    * More relaxed, doesn't worry as much
    * Don't get either end of the attention
* Third (rest)
    * More free-range

* First born
    * Reliable
    * Achievers
* Middle
    * Rebellious
    * Peacemakers
    * Lots of friends
* Last
    * Fun-loving free spirit's
    * Charming
    * Manipulative
    * Attention-seeking

One of the strongest predictors on who you are going to be

### Emerging Adulthood

1950: Average age of marriage (20 for guys, 22 for girls)

2020: Average age of marriage (about 25 for both)

Probably why birth rates are so low right now


Categorizing adults is difficult and the stages aren't that clear.
* The general trend is that you decline

Sensory acuity drops with aging
* It's because of sense organs 

Older people don't get sick as often

The brain slows down
* Decreased melanin 

The frontal lobe declines faster than old brain areas
* Why grandparents will say politically-incorrect thing

The best thing you can do for your brain health is help your physical health

Young people are adept at memorizing novel details
* After about 40, people notice that their memory is fading

Older people can do better with context

The cognitive abilities are predicted by how far away you are from dying rather than how old you are.

The stereotypical mid-life crisis does not exist
* The stakes just get higher (losing jobs, etc).

We derive satisfaction from "love" and "work"

Opposites so not attract 

Education and age-at-marriage are negatively correlated with divorce (in temporal cross-sections).

Yet, divorce rates are rising
* This is mostly because of women's independence in the workforce 
  
Cohabiting with a partner before marriage is a predictor of divorce

Parents with children in the house report less-satisfying marriage than those without.
* This can be mitigated when childcare is done by both parties

Empty-nest syndrome does not happen, rather "post-launch honeymoon"

Most people die happy 
* Negative memories fade

An unexpected death may lead to chronic depression
* Whereas an older person dying isn't as bad

After the death of a loved one:
* Frag peaks about four months after loss
* Anger peaks about five months after the loss
* Those express grief immediately do not get over it any faster
* Bereavement therapy does not seem to decrease the amount of time that graving occurs 

Erikson's stages of psychosocial development (and their virtues)

Infancy - hope

Toddlerhood - will

Preschool - purpose

Elementary school - competence

Adolescence - fidelity

Young adults - love

Middle adulthood - care

Late adulthood - wisdom

# Sensory Systems

Our eyes follows the same principles as cameras and ears and microphones

Sensation $\neq$ Perception
* Sensation is the translation of a stimulus into a neural signal
    * Perception is the recognition of a stimulus
        * A stimulus is not strictly necessary (hallucination)

Two critical concepts in the study of S&P are absolute and increment thresholds
* Absolute thresholds are sometimes called the just-detectable threshold
* Increment thresholds are sometimes called the just-detectable (or noticeable) difference

The branch of psychology that handles this is psychophysics 
* They study thresholds 

The gold standard is to detects it correctly 75% of the time
* It goes from 50% to 100%

(The book says 0% to 100%)

Once you get passed absolute threshold, it becomes linear (with respect to background light).
* The threshold is vastly different in the real world

Subliminal Message
* Falls below the absolute threshold
* There may be a priming effect

But there are things that our brain processed that we aren't aware of

We are great at differences, but really bad at absolute values.

How different do you think that light is in this classroom vs the light outside on a bright day?
* At least a million time brighter

Vision has to be 8% brighter to notice

Weight, 2%
Tone, 0.6%

### Vision

By definition, we see light

The cones (color detectors) are packed in the center of the eye. There are a lot more rods (light) and they are mostly in the sides.

Our brains are great at object recognition. We don't work like a camera because our brain handles it more.

Specialized areas:
* Gaze and head angle
* Direction of someone approach 
* Objects
* Animals

We handle:
* Color
* Motion
* Depth

Color does make that much of a difference

All vertebrate animals have color vision. So it must be important.
* Seeing an apple tree (and ripeness)

We are trichromatic (Red, green, and blue).
* Some animals have more or fewer than three color detectors

An object's color is actually what colors it reflects back

They are not independent value receptors. It's the ratio between red vs green and yellow vs blue.

### Audition

Many of the same rules as vision

However, hearing has an interesting problem to tackle:
* Directionality

Vision is in one direction, whereas sound is *everywhere*.

Sound is a wave
* We measure the intensity by decibels (in a log scale)
* We measure the frequency by Hz (the higher the frequency--shorter the wave--the higher the pitch)
    * 4 Hz is a 1/4 second between waves

## Sensory Systems II

NUpath Assignment III

Historical and cultural contingency
* There are external factors which influence people (environment)

Different places have different cultural norms 
* Ex. McDonald's employee of the month in India backfired


Major cultural topics:
* Sexual assault
* Bullying
* Gender equality
* Education 

Uniforms are used to address these problems

*What cultural value is contingent upon school dress?*

The assignment:
* What cultural norm you are addressing,
* Where you think that norm came from, and
* How you think a school uniform would impact that norm.

Examples:
* Should poor kids stand out because they don't have the right clothes
* Tyranny of choice
* What about freedom of expression?
    * Is banning yoga pants sexist?

Due Thursday, the 25th
* Reviewed by peers

---

### Audition

The outer ear catches the waves

Which travel through the ear cancel and reach the eardrum which vibrate the three bones which increase the sound to the 

Cochlea which looks like a snail where the fluids are moved which moves hair bundles move via the waves in the cochlea

Ions rush from the top of the hair cells

Which sends neurotransmitters to the auditory nerves 

So neither position nor firing rate can signal volume. What does then?
* How many of the hair bundles move (it jiggles it's neighbor hair bundles)

Loud noise are ripping the membrane (which is very measurable)

Nearly all hearing loss is structural, as opposed to neural atrophy 


Auditory localization
* We can tell when a noise is above/below us and in front/behind us
* Right and left makes sense (because right and left ears)
* Handled by the *pinna* (the structure on the outside of the head)
    * the pinna works as an echo chamber and therefore we can isolate sound

### Tactician

Sense of touch
* Actually a mix of senses with specialized nerve ending within the skin

* Meissner's corpuscles
* Pacinian corpuscles
* Merkels discs
* Free nerve endings
* Ruffini's end organs
* Hair follicles changes of the hair
* etc.

Touch is highly susceptible to top-down influences
* Rubber hand illusion

While not strictly part of touch, nearly identical nerve ending are founds in joints, tendons, and bones

**Kinesthesis** (or Proprioception): the sense of how your body is moving and where your body parts are


### Balance 

Very important sense is the *vestibular sense*
* Biological 'gyroscopes' in the semicircular canals which provide information about your head's
    * Tilt and
    * Acceleration

When we move, the otoliths move which activate hair cells

### Pain

The most studied subject in science is *pain*

Those who don't experience pain typically die in their 20s

Chronic pain is a serious problem
* When pain continues to b signaled to the brain when there isn't a reason for it

The sensation of pain is conducted in the spine, to the brain, by so-called small fibers

Pain is conducted via two classes of neurons dubbed
* A$\delta$ fibers, which control the first sharp pain
* C fibers which control the lasting pain afterwards 

Gate-control theory tries to explain why actions such as rubbing an injury make it feel better.
* It might block the pain

Highly subject to top-down processing

Very common in the phantom limbs of amputees
* Could be like the rubber hand illusion

We remember pain's severity more than the duration

We also remember the last part of the pain as the whole thing

Pain is also social-cultrual influences just like yawing is contagious so is pain

Thus, pain is both a biological an psychological phenomenon 

What is hypnosis?
* A state of heightened suggestibility

Hypnosis typically begins with hypnotic induction
* Usually gets the subject to relax

After induction, the hypnotists may be able to make the subject unaware of an object in plain sight
* But they will still move around objects

There is a Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale includes several test
* The first item on the scale is "postural sway"
    * If the subject moves from side to side when asked to imagine being a ship, they are a good subject

It is an active thing, not a passive thing
* People are trusting

Authority figures in the right context can get people to do crazy things (it's not the hypnosis)

Weight loss and pain management can be helped from hypnosis

Addictions do not seem to respond

Hypno-osurgey: one can go under surgery only being hypnotised

**Theories**:

Social Influence Theory

We may just be "playing the part"
* Peer pressure

Cognitive Dissociation Theory

We have a divided consciousness so can we move the line of conciousness?
* People who were hypnotised still feel pain but it doesn't 'hurt' them

Pain Management
* Drugs
* Surgery
* Acupuncture
* Massage
* Hypnosis
* etc.

**Placebo**

The more elaborate the placebo, the better the results

Simple distraction can even be enough

### Gustation (Taste)

The four tastes:
* Sweet
* Sour
* Salty
* Bitter

And we recently discovered:
* Savory 

Taste receptors are chemoreceptors

Taste is handled (mostly) by the tongue 

People taste differently
* People who report coffee as being bitter and green vegetables are "tasters" and those who don't are "non-tasters"

Others are "super tasters"
* Usually children

The more taste buds, the more of a "taster" you are and the more you are sensitive 

Lots of things that you eat (hot, spicy, etc) are toxic to taste buds

Taste and smell work together
* When you have a cold, things don't taste as good

Texture also plays a role in taste


### Olfaction (Smell)

The oldest sense

>5% of the genome is responsible for smell

The one sense that doesn't pass through the thalamus

Most of us don't use our sense of smell so we 'lose it'
* Some people can detect where a grape was grown by smell

We have 350 distinct oderants (compared to our 3 for sight)

The olfactory bulb is old brain and cortex

There is something called "smell memory" which seems to be very strong and deep
* Subtle fragrances can be associated with subtle events

### Perception

* An hallucination is a perception without an appropriate sensation
* Anesthesia is sensation without perception

There are also auditory illusions

Perceptual Organization

Meaningful object recognition
* Figure and ground
* Grouping
* Depth perception
* Shape and size constancy
* lightness and color constancy

You can only be attending to one thing at a time

Grouping
* Proximity
* Continuity
* Similarity
* Connectedness
* Closure

Knowing the answer doesn't help

### Depth

3d impression of the world 

Asked a baby to crawl across a glass floor, and they wouldn't. They know that there is depth

Stereopsis: The detection of the disparity between images on our retinae due to the fact that we have slightly different images between our eyes.
* More disparity means that an object is closer
* Only works for the first 25 feet or so

After 25 feet, we reply on *monocular cues*
* Works with just one eye

Things that are higher in our field we perceive as farther away.

**Relative Size**

We know just about how big something is so we can figure out how far away it is from that.


**Interposition**

If something blocks another object, that first object is closer

**Linear Perspective**

We know that parallel close to a vanishing point at a distance.

**Relative Motion**

Things that are moving at a fixed speed will seem to move quicker closer to you

(Ex driving a car, the mountains won't seem to move while the trees close to you will be moving quickly)

### Perception Principals

Shape constancy. Objects stay the same shape, so we can understand that when a door opens, it doesn't change shape.

Lightness and color constancy use context to interpret changes to patterns to provide meaning.

There's a lot of processing that goes into perception before it reaches your conciousness.

There seem to be "critical periods" for developing some of these sensory skills.

Those who fix their cataracts after childhood don't restore their vision (but their sight is still restored)

**The Perceptual Set**: The state of your top-down processors that impact what you perceive
* Important!!

Human factors psychologists work at the "man-machine interface"
* Exploiting or altering perceptual sets to maximize:
    * Usability
    * Safety
    * Comfort
    * Etc

In order for ESP to be proven, it only has to be proven *once*.

# Learning and Memory

You don't need to know what a penny looks like, you just need to know how to tell it apart from other coins.

* All animals learn
    * But we don't just acquire memories of experiences, we acquire *knowledge*
        * Product of culture and language

* Although we do a lot of conditioning learning

* Conditioning forms the basis of the behaviorism schools of psychology
    * Recall that behaviorism doesn't look at cognitive mental processes rather only results

### Types of Learning
* Classical Conditional
    * Stimuli triggers a biological response
* Operant conditioning
    * behavior is associated with consequences
* Observational 
    * behavior is learned through viewing others
* Instructional
    * Being taught

There is no formal distinction between learning and memory

Memory: learning that persists over time


### Classical Conditioning

Means the same thing as Pavlovian conditioning

Associated a ticking metronome with food appearing. Then the dogs learned that the ticking meant the arrival of meat

Classical conditioning paradigm:
* The unconditioned response (UR)
    * Example saliva
* The neural stimulus (NS)
    * Stimulus that is unrelated
    * Metronome
* The unconditioned stimulus (US)
    * Food
* The conditioned stimulus (CS)
    * Metronome
* Conditioned response (CR)
    * Saliva

TIP: the UR and the CR are always the same thing. And the NS and CS are always the same thing

So what are the rules to this? What combinations will work and what won't work?
* Yes; you need to have the metronome *before* the food.
* You can also have a second-order conditioning
* You can also weaken the association (extinction)
    * After extinction and after time, they will regain the association (called spontaneous recovery)
* They don't have to be perfect stimuli match (ex. Light being in a different place, or different pitch tuning fork)
    * Dogs will, however, learn to discriminate if one doesn't produce food

John Watson and his "Little Albert" experiment
* Tried this with humans. Showed a cute animal and than scared the child to see if they would associate the cute animal with the loud noise.

Key features
* Acquisition 
    * Pairing of NS and US leads to CS and CR
* Extinction 
    * Pairings are not necessarily forever
* Generalization
    * Stimuli sufficiently similar to the CS will trigger the CR
* Discrimination
    * Stimuli sufficiently different from the CS won't trigger the CR

A second-level predictor that doesn't always work will never be used if there is a predictor that works all the time
* It will, however, work if there isn't a 100% predictor

Your mind has to figure out what is the CS is. Not all NS can become CS. There is always cognition.

An environment or person can also be a CS.

You can even control your immune system with this
* Training your body that a smell is associated with steroids can help ween off of steroids

### Operant Conditioning

Popularized by B.F. Skinner 

Animals can learn that their behaviors have consequences

Edward Thorndike's law of effect: Rewarded behavior is likely to recur

Rewards are called *reinforcers*

Generalization and discrimination

The most ubiquitous reinforcer in modern life: money.

The schedule of reinforcement has a profound effect on behavior
* If you don't know when your manager is going to check on you, you will work harder

Basic rules of reinforcement can be either
* Fixed or variable
* Interval or ratio

**Examples**
* What schedule of reinforcement does  a salaried worker get?
* Fixed interval

* What schedule of reinforcement does a telemarketer get, assuming they get a commission per sale?
* Variable ratio

* What schedule of reinforcement does your Twitter feed offer?
* Variable interval

* What schedule of reinforcement does a "coffee club" offer?
* Fixed ratio

Peer Reviewing is due Monday

You must complete the rubric
* Clearly written
* Answers question
* Make a point

## Punishment

Things that decrease the likelihood of a behavior recurring are punishment 

Negative reinforcer: Stopping something bad (ex car alarm for seatbelts)

Positive punishment: doing something bad to you (ex spanking)

Negative punishment: taking something good away (ex grounding)

Drawbacks for punishment:
* Will suppress a behavior, but does not "unlearn it"
    * The organism just learns to do not to the thing with the punisher around
* May cause fear of resentment
* Effects relationships

However, when you combine punishment and reward, it works.

B. F. Skinner
* All oand f our behavior is based on reinforcement
* Our free will and conciousness doesn't change anything 

Cognitive Science refute to B. F. Skinner
* Rats thinks about the best path in a maze without having tried that option before

We require cognitive science to explain this.

Sometimes rewards can actually decrease responding
* If we have doubly reinforcement, we think something is suspicious

If someone is intrinsic motivated, reward will actually decrease their likelihood of doing the thing.

Animals come biologically predisposed to pairing certain reinforcers with certain actions
* It's easy to teach a pigeon to peck for food, but not to flap its wings for food

In sports, several techniques are applied to enhance competence
* People start baseball with a T and a light toss and then builds up

In the workplace, merit pay is commonplace

Ranking people by their sales can motivate everyone

If a child whines and you give in and then yell at the child, it reinforces the child's whining and your yelling.

### How to Implement Classical Conditioning 

* State your goal (operational definition)
* Monitor how often you engage in your desired behavior
* Reinforce yourself only when you do well
* Once you are regularly doing well, titrate the rewards

<div style='width: 90%' class='ui rounded images'>
<img class='ui image' src='/notes/psyc1101/lec11-fig1.png'>
</div>

## Observational Learning

This is learning by the modeling of the behaviors of others.
* People's mirror neurons light up in the same way when someone does an activity and when they are watching another person do the same activity 

Classic experiment by Albert Bandura in 1960
* Some children watched an adult "beat up" a doll, others didn't
* What happens to those who watched the aggression vs those who did not
    * Children became more aggressive (they would also do new ways of aggression)

MLK modeled nonviolent action as a force for social change

Prosocial modeling can be use therapeutically in 
* Criminal justice
* Education
* Child welfare

In your own life
* Read to your kids
* Cover your mouth when you sneeze
* Be nice to the help
* Drive safely

Video games
* Do they train people to be violent?
    * Violence caused by video games are an edge case and so we can throw out this hypothesis

* Catharsis
    * Do video games act as an outlet? No not really. It doesn't work with pornography also.

Current consensus is that violence does lead to aggressive behavior by children but how much is still up for debate.
* Does it desensitize people to violence?

**Instructional Learning**:
* Does not require trail and error, nor conditioning, nor observation 

## Memory

Memory is learning that has persisted over time

How much does active recall shape who we are?

What would happen if you lost your memory?

* Encoding
* Storage
* Retrieval 

Thee memory "banks"
* Sensory Memory
* Short-term memory
* Long-term memory

Working memory

Some memories don't pass through the conciousness and go right to long term memory

When memorizing information, your brain may be recording all kinds of superfluous information automatically. For instance

* Space
    * We may remember where a diagram is in a book
* Time
    * We rememberer sequence well 
* Frequency
    * "Wow, I just heard the word pinochle today"
* Well-learned material

Well rehearsed material can become effortless
* It is difficult or impossible to turn off 

The simplest strategy for memorization is rehearsal

Ebbinghause found that more rehearsing something difficult on day one means less time to relearn it on day two
* He was using nonsense syllables

Spacing is important to learning
* The longer the spacing, the  better the storage

Serial position effects are quite interesting because they consist both of 
* A recency effect in the near-term (you remember the last short term)
* A primacy effect in the longer term (you remember the first long term)

Putting things in context is very important 

**Mnemonic system**: the "pegword" system
* First, memorize a list of words

**Chunking**

If the information can be place into familiar chunks, it will be easier to memorize

**Hierarchies**

Putting things into bins is helpful

Short term memory is surprisingly limited
* The total number of items is 7$\pm$2
* 3-4 seconds of auditory memory 

We have no evidence that new information displaces (or removes) other information.
* We don't have any knowledge of any maximum 

Long-term memory is governed by
* Storage
* Retrieval 

*Long-term potentiation (LTP)*: increase in the strength of synapses as they are used
* Fundamental thing that governs long-term memory

There are drugs that reduce the LTP process and there are also drugs that are soon to be out that enhance LTP

Sleep also increases the LTP process

The amygdala and other components of the limbic system affect memory formation in an intensity graded fashion.

There is a drug called propranolol that lowers the stress response in the amygdala and thus mitigates formation of memoires of stressful events.
* Applies after a trauma, it can reduce the appearance of stress disorders
* It doesn't remove the memories, but it removes the emotional attachment

Memories of emotionally charged events that are crystallized are referred to a flashbulb memories
* Remember this when we are talking about PTSD 

*Explicit*: food reward
*Implicit*: just explores the maze

*Explicit* memory is of of those facts and experiences that one can declare ("This is Beethoven's 5th")

*Implicit* memory is retention outside of the conciousness ("I know I've heard this tune before")

You don't know how to ride a bike. You can, but you don't know exactly.

The most famous research subject in psychology's history is H.M. (Henry Molaison)
* Can never have new explicit memories
* He could still learn things but doesn't consciously know that he knows things

## Learning and Memory II

Recall that H.M. can't remember anything consciously but can still remember.
* Him and Clyde lost their explicit memories, but kept their implicit ones 

Retrograde amnesia
* Inability to recall past memories

Anterograde amnesia
* Inability to create new memoires 

Hippocampus is active during sleep
* Left region - language
* Right region - spatial memory

Cerebellum is responsible for *implicit* memories 
Hippocampus is responsible for *explicit* memories 

Infantile amnesia
* Can't remember anything when we are really young

Alzheimer's
* Loose explicit memories
* Can lay down new implicit memories 

## Retrieval

We need to show that we can retrieve information and memories 

Retrieval cues
* Remember that our information is just a web
* The more cues, the better the retrieval

Priming
* Context matters 
* Be in the same place, you can recall better the stuff that you learned there (same with different states of mind)

Deja Vu
* False recognition

Mood also taints the retrieval of previous memories

## Forgetting/Memory Failure
* Fails to encode things

### Storage Decay

Ebbinghous' "forgetting curve"
* You lose a lot quickly but then it levels off

In retrieval failure, you haven't forgotten
* You just need more cues

**Interference**
* *proactive* - previous knowledge slows the learning of new material 
* *retroactive* - current knowledge 'kicks' out old knowledge (overriding)

"Sleeping on it" works
* Limited interference

Freud said that we repress bad memories
* This is **false**; we obsess over them

Sensory memory/working memory
* Lasts only a few seconds
* What is currently active
* Parts
    * Phonological loop
    * Episodic Buffer
    * Visuospatial Sketch Pad

Consolidation
* Sorted into important information and encodes into memory accordingly

Reconsolidation
* Recalling the memory (and distorts the memory)
* Re encoded (depending on context) 

Flashbulb Memory
* Memories that we vivid (however, the accuracy often fades)

The frailest part of a memory is the source.

Children can create memories so vivid that they and researchers can't tell true from false
* We can fool ourselves
    * "I never really loved my ex"

When asked about our views 10 years ago, we often say things that are closer to present day's views.
  
Loftus' work shows that 'recovering' memories is dangerous.
* Memories are fragile

Use neutral language to to try to recover information.

# Cognition

Thinking
* Learning
* Remembering
* etc.

We place things into bins (or concepts)

*Prototype* - the exemplar for a given type

Thinking
* Sometimes it's trail and error
* But we often use *heuristics* (intuition when not concious of it)
* Afterwards, we use *algorithms*.


This is why we think things are funny
* Things we aren't excepting

By studying how thinking fails, we can understand how it works

* **Confirmation Bias**
* **Fixation**
    * Hard to reorganize our thoughts on a problem
    * "Think outside the box", but the box works
    * Duncker's candle problem
        * Functionally fixated

Some heuristics 
* Representativeness
    * The closest to our prototype
    * "slim, poetry fan", truck driver or Ivy League professor?
* Availability
    * How emotionally charged our thoughts are
    * "Terrorists are Muslim" 
* Overconfidence
    * We overestimate ourselves
    * 90% of people say that they have above average IQ's
* Belief perseverance
    * Willingness to cling to data and beliefs in the face of contrary evidence (even overwhelming)

Availability and belief perseverance is what causes "-isms" (racism, sexism, etc.)

A good way to overcome this:
* "If this piece of data had been opposite, would you still not consider it reliable?"

### Intuition

These issues all impact our intuition (which is why it's hard to overcome this).

For example, chess masters can make their best move within a few seconds (without actually thinking through every move).

"sleeping on it" really does work.

Although intuition doesn't work all the time, it does more good than harm.

**Framing**:
* The manipulation of the truth and it impacts our decisions and our judgment (it's not lying)
* Examples:
    * "I'm pro-life"
    * "I'm against the death tax"
    * "50% off regular price!"
    * Organ donors being opt-out vs opt-in
* Fear tactics:
    * Terrorist attacks kill less people than falling down the stairs do

Fear is one of the best ways for someone to manipulate you.

## Language

* "People are not animals"
    * People often cite language

*Language*: a mechanism by which we can transfer meaning, learning and ideas from one mind to another.

The basic building block of the spoken word is the phoneme. 

There are 869 phonemes in use throughout all the languages of the world
* There are about 40 in the English language

Sign languages also have phonemes

We carry an accent if we learn another language as adults


*Morpheme*: the smallest unit of meaning (any one syllable thing that has meaning)
* -ed
* -er, or
* Un-

Or like
* I,
* Dog,
* Bat

We build morphemes and words into phrases and phrases into sentences, etc.

*Grammar*: the rules that govern our language 
* Semantics
    * The individuals interpretation of language's meaning based on prior knowledge of signifiers
* Syntax
    * The combinatorial rules that dictate correct sentence construction

Consider: "Getting yourself to the gym often is a challenge."
* This can either mean that getting to the gym once is a challenge, but to frequent the gym is hard

Babies go through an explosive language development process

| Month | Stage                                |
|-------|--------------------------------------|
| 4     | Babbling, variety of sounds          |
| 10    | Babbling, household language         |
| 12    | One-word stage.                      |
| 24    | Two-word telegraphic speech          |
| 24+   | Rapid development, complex sentences |

Even when babies say just two words, they are syntactically correct: they say "want milk" and not "milk want".

Noam Chomsky said that it doesn't have to be reinforced for the child to say things.

We have a language acquisition device built in and therefore we see a lot of similarities across languages.
* Babies across cultures follow the same stages
* Children know what syntax is correct without reinforcement

Recall that if one eye is occluded or misaligned in childhood, you can't fully develop it in adulthood. Same with language.

Occasionally, cases of neglect or abuse can leave children with underdeveloped (or, in extreme cases no) language at all.

Deaf children can't develop language. Deaf children who were born into non-signing families and latter learned sign, don't remember their time without language. 

If we have a name for a color, it actually makes it easier to remember it and pick it out of a pallet again.

Could it be that personality is a result of language?
* The Whorfian hypothesis

If you are an expert in something, just thinking about it can help you improve.
* Pianists can get better without actually practicing

If you visualize the journey and not the destination.
* Visualize what you need to do to get the outcome that you want

Is language the thing that separates us from other animals?

Other animals can think

Chimps even seem to have culture.
* One group might use one kind of tool to complete a task, another might use a different tool

Nonhuman primates have
* Symbol recognition
* A bit of grammar
* Concept of narrative

Skeptics counter that
* Every new word is a labor for primates
* Much of what they do can be explained by operant conditioning 
* The scientists who train these monkeys have a vested interest in seeing them succeed. Do they have a bias?
* Chimps have a very hard time with grammar, making little distinction between "you tickle" and "tickle you"
* Some novelties (ie "water bird) could just be two different ideas

Chimps often pass on sign language to their children.

Thomas Sebeok, linguist
* Three groups of chimp language projects
    * Fraud
    * Self-deception (the largest group)
    * those conducted by Terrace


Birds, however, can speak language and 'communicate' through it.
* They, however, still don't have real human language

If animals are shown to have rich cognitive lives, there would be ethical questions.

# Intelligence

One of the most controversial parts of psychology.

What is intelligence?
* The ability to solve mental problems.
* We generally associate intelligence with IQ.
    * We don't use IQ anymore, however

Spearman is a intelligence researcher who stated that if you are good at one type of problem, you are probably also good at another type of problem (called this `g`).
* There is one intelligence

Thurstone said that it is possible to have separable intelligences.

`g` is measured by every task on a standard intelligence inventory (test).

*Savants*: people who excel in one aspect but have a low `g`.


[Midterm 2](/notes/psyc1101/midterm2)

What does the constant movement of our eyes do?
* Sensory adaptation

How many phonemes and morphemes are in the word "rethinks"?
* 7; 3

The claim that hypnotic phenomena are regulated by normal conscious processes is associated with the theory that hypnosis reflects the power of what?
* Social influence/pressure

Who were the group of psychologists who first identified principals for organized stimuli into coherent groups and which of their principals makes you see a lightbulb?
* Gestaltists - Closure

What were the "psychic secretions" that lead to Pavlov's experiments on associative learning, and what did he eventually come to call them?
* Dogs are drooling before the food arrives; Conditioned responses

If people quit the stock market after taking big losses in the 2008 crash, and then missed out on all the gains since then, what principal would that be illustrating?
* Punishment (important)

What do Chomsky and other linguists argue we must come endowed with in order to acquire language?
* Language acquisition device (grammar)

Gardner famously argued for multiple intelligences identifying a total of 7(+1), and advocating for customized education for each.
* Do all these things really all look like "intelligence" to you?
    * Bodily-kinesthetic?
    * Spatial (like artist)

Gardner said that we can't be good at all of these different things (only so much brain)
* But there are people who are great at everything
* `g` really does seem to matter

Th correlation between IQ and financial success is about 0.3 (so less than 10% correlation).

Now intelligence is seen to have three major subcategories:

* Analytical
    * Closest to IQ
* Creative
    * Deal with new situations
* Practical
    * Great haggler or salesman
    * Best predictor of financial success

It does seem like some degree of high analytical intelligence is necessary for geniuses (like scientists) but that isn't the case. They need creativity.


Fermat's Last Theorem (1637); it was proven in 1995 (using a new idea in mathematics: the modularity conjecture).

Newton's laws of Physics and Einsteins theory of relativity 


**Four axis's of Intelligence**:
* Expertise

* Imagination

* A venturesome personality

* Motivation

But there is another one (that is debatable):

* Emotional intelligence

The typical brain weighs about 3 lbs.

Do big brains make geniuses? 
* There is a reasonable correlation between brain size and intelligence (r $\approx$ 0.33)
    * Einstein had a disproportionally large ventral parietal lobe

Brain size is not as correlated as much as brain speed
* Brain speed and intelligence (r $\approx$ 0.5)


### IQ

IQ: What is the Q? Quotient.

In France, they said that all students should be educated and noticed that some people fell behind and others excelled. They wanted to figure it out.

They hire Alfred Binet to develop a test that compared "typical" skills in children at each grade year. He then divided an individual's age with their mental age (at what age would this seem normal?). Examples: 8 year old performing as a 10 year old: 10/8 = 1.25
* But he saw an issue with this

Lewis Terman took Binet's tests and modified them for not just school children. But this doesn't work with adults. So now there isn't any ratio and therefore no quotient.


IQ tests must meet three criteria to be worthwhile:

* They must be standardized
    * Everyone's tests must be relatable to a general population 
* They must be reliable
    * Gets the same results for the same person
* They must be valid
    * The hardest one. Must actually report what it should report. We don't agree what intelligence is

The most common tests are by David Wechsler


Wechsler Adult Intelligence Score (WAIS)
* See the breakdown of scores

There are different kinds of intelligence tests. For example, midterm exams.

IQ tests are designed to be *qptitude* tests.

IQ tests have an average of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.

SAT has an average of 1000 and a standard deviation of 150.

James "Flynn effect" notes that normalized IQs are rising! So what are we actually measuring?

Just because a test is reliable does not mean that it is valid. Validity for IQ tests can be difficult to assure. We need to see that these tests predict some achievement (academic, professional, etc.).

Good news:
* Modern IQ tests are very reliable

Bad news:
* They aren't very valid
* The SATs do a better job at predicting college grades than the GREs do at predicting graduate school grades.
    * This is because those who take the SAT are those who are likely to excel at them

We don't have good tools to predict adult intelligence before age 4.
* Disability is apparent, however.

IQ at age 11 is a predictor of IQ 60 years later


Extreme Intelligence
* Children with very high IQs typically thrive socially as well

Overall, children with high IQs typically end up with professions with doctors, lawyers, etc.

How should we treat gifted minds and ungifted minds?
* If the gifted people are the one's who push society forward, should we devote our resources to them? Taking them away from the ungifted?

How heritable is intelligence?

Lewis Terman was a racist and wanted to prove that some races are more intelligent (but the tests weren't appropriate for other races).

**Twins**:

Identical twins who are raised together have near-identical IQs

Identical twins who are raised separately drop slightly

Correlation in between children and biological parents

Above 50% heritable. (Mostly genetic.)

NOTE: How heritable something is depends upon how strong the environment effect is.

Poverty is an environment factor that can push a lot of people to the margins.

Does Head Start (helping impoverished children) work?
* Yes. But as children age, the effect disappears

### Gender Differences 
IQ is what the SAT tests. Boys and girls do almost exactly as well
* However, girls slightly outperform boys

Boys have a broader distribution of IQ than girls.

### Race Difference

In the US, white IQ is about 100 whereas other races have different averages.

There are no differences in brains between races.
* The differences in average are attributed to social factors and environmental factors

If you say that their 'kind' does really well on a test, their scores go up and vice versa.

The vast majority of scientists think that genetics play a small role in intelligence.

Is Binet's fear being realized? That is, is our reliance on IQ testing discriminatory?

# Motivation

Where does motivation come from? Levels of analysis:
* Evolutionary psychology
* Drives and incentives
* Arousal
* Motivation hierarchies

Recall the different types of intelligence.

Darwin's book makes us realize that instincts are endowed upon us (food, water, etc.).

Instinct:
* Fixed pattern throughout the species
* It must be unlearned

This should not discount the role of evolution, however.

Two ways to motivations: 
* What the body needs
* What the mind wants

These needs and wants express themselves as drives. When a psychological need increases, a psychological motivation increases.

Homeostasis: our body wants to get back to baseline state


If you smell something good and then want to eat it, is this really homeostasis? You are pulled by the smell.

Our drives are both "pushed" by our needs and "pulled" by our instincts. 

When all those basic needs are met, we often get "cabin fever" and feel the need to head out and explore.

We need stimulation
* There are reward centers in the brain that activate just for learning and experiencing something new.

Smartphones fill this need
* Distracting and fulfills our need

Chronic stimulation (like smartphones) can make you:
* Stressed
* Jittery
* According to new research, stupid

Maslow's hierarchy of needs:

There are some needs that are physical needs (foot, water, shelter, etc.) and then you go up the pyramid which is self-fulfillment and belonging.

Happiness increases when you give food and shelter to poor countries. That increase isn't as apparent in rich countries.

### Hunger

When people are starving, they become "like animals" literally fighting over scrapes of food.

Other wants and needs drop when you lack food.

If you don't consume food, food consumes you.

What is hunger?
* We are motivated to find food

The pancreas, which is a gland located right next to the stomach, secretes insulin.

Hypothalamus: responds to the key apatite hormones in the body 
* Has multiple regions that monitor blood chemistry and regulate different hormones that controls hunger responses.

Grehlin is secreted by the empty stomach

The anti-grehlin is obestatin

These hormones are *homeostatic*. They work in concert to try to return the body to its baseline weight.

If you lose weight, your basal metabolic rate will drop, whereas if you gain weight, it will increase.

There seems to be a purely cognitive aspect to hunger as well.

Why do we stay the same weight?

There are two competing ideas:
* The "set point"
    * The limbic system monitors our weight and works to maintain a specific weight
* The "settling point" (favored theory)
    * Suggests that we have a fairly constant weight because we maintain a fairly constant caloric intake and energy expenditure

We don't need to taught to like salty or sweet. All other tastes are apparently conditioned.

Eating novel foods makes us like them more, and also makes us more willing to try other novel foods in the future.

Eating is also a social phenomenon
* We eat with others. We eat more with others.

Eating also depends upon presentation
* Given a full quart of ice cream and
    * A small bowl, you will probably fill the bowl and eat less than if given
    * A large bowl which you will probably also fill (even though you could have just had two smaller bowls, you don't)

Obesity is both a literally and figuratively growing problem
* Since hunger (a mental state) an eating (a behavior) are psychological phenomena, obesity can be thought of a psychological problem at its core

Eating disorders
* Anorexia nervosa
    * Dieting past the point of health
* Bulimia nervosa
    * Fluctuates between times of purging and dieting
* Binge-eating
    * Bulimia without the purging

Overwhelmingly affect women, typically in the adolescent years or early 20s

Mothers of girls with eating disorders tend to focus on both their own and their daughters' weight and appearance.

Families of anorexics tend to be high-achieving and competitive.
* Anorexia is a "disease of affluence"

Families of bulimics have higher-than-usual incidences of obesity and low self-esteem

Identical twins are somewhat more likely to share an eating disorder than fraternal twins, but surprising, eating disorders don't seem to be all that heritable

In western cultures, where eating disorders are on the rise, a corresponding decrease in body image is found in women.

People who are alone and told to take a math test in a swim suit perform worse.

Once upon a time, when food was scarce, a little "heft" was a signal of social status

In 2016, 
* 2.2 billion adults are overweight
* 100 million children under 18 are also "obese"
    * 20 million of those are under age 5

Among the many health risks accompanying obesity is diabetes
* We are in for an epidemic of diabetes

Being "pear" shaped is better than being "apple" shape

**Social Impacts**

Gaining 30 lbs, people were rejected from jobs more frequently
* Women, more so

This also has a halo effect. It affects those who hang out with overweight people.

Why is it so hard to lose weight?

Every pound of fat contains about 3,500 calories.
* Therefore, to lose a pound of fat, you need to cut out 3,500 calories, right?
    * In theory yes, but in reality, due to homeostatic mechanisms, no. 

Unfortunately, fat cells don't just multiply as you become obese, they also enlarge.

You wind up with more and now "starving" fat cells after you gain weight and then diet.

Two things are fight against you trying to lose weight:
* Body's homeostatic mechanisms
* Second, your fat cells are sending signals to eat more

There is no diet that scientifically works. Weight Watchers (the best one) just stops you from gaining more weight. It does nothing.

Adopted children's body weight is uncorrelated with their siblings' or their (adoptive) parents

Identical twins are usually very close in weight.

The hight rates of obesity is fairly new
* It's the environment, not our genetics

What causes obesity
* More television viewing
* Better, labor saving tools, including the automobile
    * The Amish has 1/7th the rate than the rest of America
* Food consumption patterns have shifted dramatically
    * Women and men now eat 300 and 200 more calories respectively 

Global warming and obesity are the same problem
* If people bike instead of drive to work, it solves both

People do have a spike in body weight in college (change in environment)

The WHO has drafted an anti-obesity charter
* They ask that the private sector reduce advertising of sugary foods to children
* Commits government to
    * Increasing access to health foods and
    * Increasing walkways and bike ways

We can also put a tax (the "Twinkie Tax") on junk food

Bloomberg banned supersized soda was ruled unconstitutional by a court in NY
* What do you think?
    * We need better education

Asked if they would rather "be five years younger or weight 15 lbs less"
* 48% of women would chose 15 lbs
* about 25% of men would too

Once you reach a state of obesity, it is nearly impossible to get all the way back to a healthy weight and stay there.

Some tips to lose weight:
* Don't start your diet until you are really ready to.
* Slow and steady weight loss -- 1 to 2 pounds a week
* Diet must be low-calorie, so to stay stimulated, eat a wide range of healthy foods
    * Try to avoid exposure to junk foods
    * Don't binge -- but don't get discouraged when you slip
* Be more physically active

What about those people who eat and eat but don't seem to gain any weight?
* What makes them different?

## Sexual Motivation

Where should sex be in Maslow's hierarchy?

The individual don't need it, but the society does.

It can provide
* A feeling of being loved
* Self esteem and even
* Self satisfaction

If sex is fundamental to the survival of the species, then the process of natural selection will have made sure that our behaviors around it are very, very sophisticated.
* Evolution makes sure to get everything right

Alfred Kinsey' founded "Kinsey's Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction"

The actual act of sex remained very poorly understood until the middle of the 1960s (Masters and Johnson)
* Sexual acts were one of the first things to be drawn in caves.

Masters and Johnson managed to talk hundreds of people into performing sex acts in the 1950s.

Four phases in the sexual response cycle:
* Excitement
* Plateau
    * Excitement peaks and breathing, pulse, and blood pressure increase 
* Orgasm
* Resolution
    * Homeostatic mechanisms 

Men have a refectory period. That is, men have to go through resolution before they can repeat the cycle.

It was originally believed that orgasm is to reward people for having sex (and passing on genes).

But for women, it helps with fertilisation 

Freud proposed that there were two kinds of orgasm:
* Vaginal (the 'right' kind)
* Clitoral (A 'neurotic' kind)

But it turns out that this isn't true. There is only one kind (for both men and women).

Many men physically unable to have sex (ED) or may suffer from premature ejaculation. Women can always have sex, however, they may not desire it (it can also be painful or uncomfortable).

Sexual dysfunction in men and women often responds well to therapy. Viagra is the most successful drug in the last 50ish years.

There hasn't been such a product for women, however.

### Hormones 

Sex hormones: estrogen, and testosterone

In lower mammals:
* Females can be brought into heat with estrogen 
* Males are much more difficult to regulate hormonally

The link between hormones and sexual motivation:
* Women are more receptive to sex during periods of peak fertility (ovulation)
    * They dress more sexually
    * have sex more frequently
* Men secrete more testosterone
    * when they are single
    * during socialization
    * when they view sexual material

It is testosterone for women that the most arousal. 

In both women and (especially) men, sex hormones "change with the wind".

Yet both women and (especially) men's sexual motivations remain fairly flat.

Both sexes' 

We need *some* sex hormones. But more is not always better.

It is common knowledge that men often like to see, hear, read, sexually stimulating material. This is equally arousing to women. The more sexually stimulating material one sees, the less arousal it instills (increase *tolerance*).

There are documented adverse effects to the viewing of sexual stimuli.
* Especially those in which sexual coercion is the message. Such imagery can make the viewer more accepting to horrific ideas.
* Viewing pornographic materials makes sexual patterns less satisfied with their own sex
* Pornographic materials also make their own partners seem less attractive

95% of both men and women say they have sexual fantasies.
* 1/5 women and 1/10 men report fantasizing about being "taken" by a desirable person passionate for them. This does *not* translate into the real desire to be sexually assaulted. 

This generation is the first that grew up with instant pornographic sex anytime.

Young people are having a lot more sex today then they were a century ago. A lot.
* At the turn of the century, 3% has premarital sex by the age of 18. Today, it's over 50%.

Teen pregnancy is on the rise overall (although it waxes and wanes). Teens are also less likely to have smart (protected) sex:
* Ignorance
* Discomfort with the topic of birth control
* Guilty feelings with respect to sex
* Alcohol or other intoxications
* Wide availability of pornographic material.

We are the first generation that sex has significantly decreased than the generation that came before you.

The modern libido is way down today.

With the arrival of DSL (broadband internet), there is a 7-13% decline in teen pregnancy therein.

There is less incentive to seek these things out in the real world.

Sex facts:
* Porn viewed daily
    * 50-99% of men
    * 30-85% of women
* Most sexually active women use a vibrator
* Having sex at least once per week
    * Lowers men's risks of
        * Heart disease by 30%
        * Diabetes by 40%
        * Stroke by 40%
        * Dying before the age of 80 by 60%

More than 15% of women and 6% of men do not say that they are completely straight.

Who is gay?
* Conservative Americans state that about 20%  of people are gay
* Liberal Americans put it at about 10%
* Census data and scientific surveys put the number closer 2-4%

Homosexuals are certainly in the minority
* Thus the human rights of this population must be protected 

The APA dropped homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses in 1973.
* The WHO didn't do so until 1993
* China only dropped it in 2001
* In much of the world, it is still considered a disease

It is not associated with any mental disorder or social problem 
* There are no increased risk of any diseases in the homosexual population

Very, very few regularly go both ways (both sexes). But women are more often bisexual.

Eye-tracking experiments reveal that when shown pictures of couples:
* Men dwell on the women
* Women study both

Meredith Chivers had groups of people watch different kinds of pornographic. And asked them what they wanted to see. After viewing, when asked them what turned them on, they were consistent with what they said. However, the arousal was interesting:
* Straight men: consistent
* Gay men: consistent
* Straight women: aroused by everything
* Gay women: aroused by everything

Homosexuality is associated with increased risk of suicide, primarily in adolescence.

Male homosexuality is associated with dramatically increased sexual activity. This is true.

Female homosexuality is associated more with long-term relationships.
* But they also have more sex than straight couples

Where does homosexuality come from? The leading theory is that it is mostly genetic but also hormones (in the womb).
* The more older brothers a man has, the more likely has is to be gay

Homosexual stereotypes: 
* Poets (24%)
* Fiction writers (21%) and
* Artists and musicians (15%)

We cannot turn people 'gay', we can just have them to go for something that's not their first choice.

Homosexuality does
* Run in families
* Occur more commonly among identical twins when one is gay.

Homosexuality is not influenced by adopted parents (hints that it's genetic).

**Is it a choice?**

For women, the answer is a somewhat equivocal "Yes, maybe some of the time."

For men, it is a stronger "No, usually not"

The things that determine sexual orientation may be only in utero.

One fairly reliable difference between gay men and heterosexual men and women is a cell cluster in the hypothalamus.

Homosexual men tend to have more homosexual on their mother's side of the family.

**How can it be that we have gay genes? Wouldn't evolution filter this out?**

The data suggests that these genes allow women to be more desirable to men.

In the rats that were given hormones "prenatal" resulted in "gay" rats. 

Male brains tend to be better at spatial tasks
* Gay men act like women in these tasks

Lesbian women aren't as sensitive to crying babies than in straight women.

Homosexuality is largely biologically based, but maybe not particularly genetically so. 

Sexual intimacy is an expression of a profoundly social nature. It adds to our sense of belonging.

We have a profound need to belong.
* The ultimate sense of belonging comes from being in a loving relationship

### Belonging

When we form groups that then disperse, we vow to "keep in touch"

When relationships break down, we are unhappy.

"Chain migration" makes life a lot easier for the subsequent families upon arrival in our string land
* Think about the China town example

Failure to belong can be devastating
* Why time-outs work

What happens to people who never really belong?
* They become unpleasant 

People derives satisfaction from working 

When we are working, we can get "in the zone" and the work itself becomes the reward (this is called flow).

Personnel psychologists work with organizations to devise methods to 
* Recruit
* Evaluate
* Train
* Increase the productivity

Interviews aren't very good at seeing how people will perform

# Emotions

What is an emotion? 

Addressing two questions: 
* Why do we have emotions?
* Where do emotions come from?

Emotions can't exist just to give us interesting experiences. They must be beneficial for the survival of our species.

They can arousing psychological states that lead to expressive behavior

Are emotions caused by the actions/reactions or do the emotions cause them?

William James said "We feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike, and afraid because we tremble"

Fear, anger, and passion have the same reaction so how do we know the difference?

James-Lange theory would suggest that those who are paralyzed don't feel as strong of emotions and the data supports this.

There is clear support for the Cannon-Bard theory (which states that you look down at your reactions to cause emotions) as well. If you are expected wind, you are less likely to interpret it as an animal.

Negative emotions are linked to the right hemisphere

Positive emotions are linked to the left hemisphere

Depending on your state of arousal, you respond to things differently.
* If you went on a run and found a loved one, you will be more excited then if you just woke up from a nap.

Recall psychoactive drugs. Choosing to use was a key ingredient of enjoying using.

Scientists have used drugs to alter our states of psychological arousal. It's not sufficient for a true emotion, however. You need the cognitive thoughts.
* If biochemistry is all there is to explain emotions, all subjects should react the same (not dependent on the cognitive thought processes). This, however, is not the case.

Physiological states are an important part of emotion, still.

People often "catch" the emotions of other people -- they are contagious.

There is a powerful connection between our control/power over ourselves and our emotions. We can not enjoy seemingly pleasurable things if they aren't controlled by us -- if we are primed in a certain way.

Priming works with emotions as well.
* We can change people's state of minds even if the subjects aren't aware of the stimuli

Jospeph LeDoux's "low road"
* Goes right to our emotions and skips our concious awareness

Even if we aren't intellectually afraid of spiders, if one fell on your lap right now, you would jump.

Often, our unconscious mind can override our cognitive, thinking, emotive mind despite ourselves.
* For example, the "beer test" is a great predictor on election results. That is, who is the best to have a beer with?

### Expressing and Detecting Emotion

We all wear our emotions on our sleeves:
* Handshake
* Averted gaze
* Lingering eye contact
* A smile

We can tell the tone of a speech in another language.

People who are acting inappropriately "pop out" to us.

We can often see a bad actor when we see one.

Can we tell when people are lying?

We are readily biased in our perception of emotion by our past experiences 
* Children who were abused were likely to say a face was angry much before the other children do

Prof. Judy Hall's "thin slices"
* Take a small piece of people's conversation and then ask subjects to analyse people's emotions and relationships
    * College women do better than college men in all of these questions

Women display great ability to detect emotions.

Women's nonverbal sensitivity (likely) underpins their greater emotional fluency
* Women display greater emotional responsiveness (except for anger)

Women identify as more empathetic than men.
* However, men and women can identify emotions just as well
    * However, women can put themselves in the person's shoes more easily

The expression of emotion is also gendered. We emote differently.

Smell research
* Males can detect females' smell and vice versa

There is also a role of olfaction in emotion.

### Emotion and Culture

How universal are these emotions?

Why is this:
* Is We live in a world that is interconnected or
* Do we carry our emotions in our genes?

We carry then in our genes. Even the most isolated people on earth show their emotions the exact same way.

They, however, are still influenced by culture.

Facial expressions do contain "accents" that can provide clues to their culture.

We can detect our own culture's emotions better, but we are very good with everyone.

The blind also have the same facial expressions.

We are good at seeing the emotions of other animals as well.

Emotional expression is inherently social. There is no point in doing it by yourself.

It also makes the emotion more powerful. The act of emoting increases the feeling of the emotion.
* When you do this, you enhance your emotions

Even if you don't do it yourself, if your eyes are pinched together, you will feel more angry.

How many emotions are there? There is no agreement; maybe 10.

But what about the other emotions such as love and jealousy?
* These might be combinations of emotions

Piaget: Just as we develop cognitively and morally, in stages, so too might we develop emotional in stages.

Disgust 
* An emotion that originates from the mouth, however, we can be disgusted by abstract ideas.
* Children start by being okay drinking liquid when there used to be a bug in it, whereas older children don't.

### Anger

Anger is, by some accounts, the easiest to detect emotion.

Chronic anger can be debilitating

What is good advice for anger?

There is mixed evidence?
* Is it a good idea to confront the person to made you angry?
    * First, you have to attack the person that actually wronged you, the counterattack is justified, and the provocateur is not intimidating.
* What about venting?
    * Primarily in individualistic cultures
    * Catharsis doesn't work with sex, so would it work here?
    * Catharsis has two major downfalls:
        * Darwin suggested that acting our emotions increases them
        * Second remember operant conditioning
            * Even if we are successful in alleviating our anger by acting out rage, then this will reinforce acting out rage. This is negative reinforcement

What's the ideal way to deal with anger?
* Just letting time pass is a good way to go
* Engage in positive activities (also, you can reinforce the positive activities)
* Talk it out. It's beneficial

### Happiness

We make better decisions when we are happy.

Women who looked happier in their yearbook photos in 1950 have happier lives in their midlife.

The "feel-good, do-good" principal. It is contagious

The day after a "bad day" is most often a good day.

Major disabilities do leave people a little less happy on average, but not as much as you might think.

73% of Americans responded that they thought they would be happier if they had more money.
* Is this true?
    * Rich countries tend to be happier than poor countries

People's income has been increasing over the past 50 years, and people's happiness has stayed about the same.

People who describe themselves as being "hard-driven" tend to me less happy.
* They always want more

People who are happy strive for personal relationships.

Would utopia ever be possible? Not really, because we see the changes in emotions more than the objective reality.

We also comparison

> "if you desire glory, you may envy Napoleon, but Napoleon envied Caesar, Caesar envied Alexander, and Alexander, I daresay, envied Hercules, who never existed.” - Bertrand Russel 

Comparing yourself to those who are less fortunate, we feel better about ourselves.

Being attractive does make you happier. So does exercise, work, relationships, etc. The rest of it is people's genes.

What can you do to be happy?
* Realize financial success does not equal well-being 
* Master your use of time
* Act happy
* Engage your skills
* Exercise
* Sleep
* Seek and nurture intimate relationships
* Go good
* Count your blessing

### Stress

Stress is the opposite of happiness

Stress can be good -- it can help people perform.

However, too much stress can negatively impact us
* Correlates to health problems down the line

The reaction of acute stress is typically elevation in adrenalin and noradrenaline.

Men tend to favor more aggressive means to coping as opposed to women.

The General Adaption Syndrome (GAS) describes the pattern of responses that the body goes through after being prompted by a stressor.

The death of a loved one, a divorce, or the loss of the job can lead to a prolonged sense of insecurity.

People die soon after the death of the loved one.

Market depressions don't end for the people who are effected by them.

Stress also affects our heart.

Type A people are competitive, motivated, and quick to anger
* More prone to heart failures. In a continuous state of fight or flight. Don't live as long.
Type B are easygoing and laid back

Pessimism also seems to be detrimental to heart-health.

Depression, too, is bad for your physical health.

The immune system is a delicately balance instrument.
* Our mind does have the ability to control this via stress

Does stress cause one to progress from HIV to AIDS more quickly? Yes.

This, however, is not (as much) the case with cancer.

Stress also promotes unhealthy behaviors (such as smoking, drinking, etc.).

Alternative medicine seek to improve health in part part by relieving stress.

### Promoting Health

Give people control over their environment.
