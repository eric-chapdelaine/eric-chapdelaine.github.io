# Introduction and Overview

What is psychology? A science
* 300 BC: Aristotle thinks about thinking (introspection)
* 1653 "study of the soul" (Philipp Melanchthon)
* Predict the behaviors of and explain the motivations of and manipulate the
  emotions of people

Humanist Psychology
* Maslow: need to help humans

Psychology's Biggest Question:
* Nature vs. Nurture
    * Biology vs. Environment and experience.
    * Nurture works on what nature endows

Levels of Analysis
* In order to answer a question, you must first decide which level you want to
  answer it on
    * The big 3: Biological, psychological, social-cultural

Apple is a *human factors* company
* When they make a feature, it is very easy to use which makes them a very
  valuable company

# The Scientific Method

There are three types of lies: lies, damned lies, and *statistics*.

Ex. You need to run trials before you can put your drug out there. And it needs to be statistically better than what's already out there.

## Statistics

On the air you can say a extreme lies (ex. "mile high pie"), but you can't say a lie that sounds reasonable (ex. "8-inch-high-pie)--unless it's true.

How things are presented make a huge difference.

Every time you simplify a finding, you sacrifice completeness
* Ex: Averages

### Averages
* Mean - Typically the arithmetic average.
* Median - 50th percentile, or middle number of a rank-ordered sequence
* Mode - Most commonly occurring value
* The Middle - The mean of the high and low end

### Bias

Bias in data means that a result will tend to be reported as either too high or too low.

The bell curve or *normal distribution curve* represents a population.

The mean and median can often not tell the same story: for example, if all of us have 5 dollars and one person walks in with 500 dollars and steals our money, the median went down and the mean went up.

### Variability

Variability is great is sports, but bad everywhere else. Averages derived from scores with low variability are more reliable than averages based on scores with high variability.

### Standard Deviations

Means and Standard Deviations are descriptives. They tell us about data.

When we calculate test statistics to decide if a difference is *meaningful*, we want to be sure that it is
* If we are 95% sure, then we say a difference is "significant"

The *central limit theorem* states that the distribution of the estimates of the *mean* drawn from any population -- even one that is not normally distributed -- will be approximately normally distributed if the sample is sufficiently large.
* We want the values to fall outside of the lines in a distributions like these so that we are 95% sure 

Saying that an effect is significant doesn't mean that the effect is large, only that we are certain that it exists.

The SD of the means that we would get if we kept sampling the population is called the standard error of of the mean (SEM).

The SEM decreases with the square root of sample size ($n$):

$SEM = \frac{SD}{\sqrt{n}}$ 

Thus, we get diminishing returns with increasing sample size.
* More is better, but every 1 added is less and less important

The population of your sample is very important

### Correlations

Correlations are defined by a coefficient called Pearson's Product Moment and abbreviated "r".
* $r$ can range from -1 to 1.
* The closer the magnitude of $r$ is to +/- 1, the more it is correlated

The square of $r$ is often taken as a measure of the proportion of the variability of one parameter.
* Ex. If the $r$ value of IQ and academic achievement is 0.5, then IQ makes up about 25% of your academic achievement 

Correlation is the *only* thing to imply causation.

If an off correlation holds up over repeated studies, however, it *is* probably causal somehow.

Correlations are really sensitive to outliers

### Hindsight Bias

Hindsight bias is the phenomenon of seeing an event that already occurred as being easily predictable when, in fact, before it happened, it was not.
* This is a major issue in law: Amazon is the only Web vendor with "one click shopping." Obvious?
    * It is *now*

We also have a tendency to be overconfident. We must be:
* Curious,
* Skeptical, and
* Humble.

### Case Studies

Studying an individual or group to study a population of a whole.

For example, if a blind person is missing a part of their brain, then we can hypothesize that that part of the brain is responsible for seeing.

The plural of anecdotes is *not* results--but it is data.


### Experiments

In an experiment we typically have
* A control group, and
* One or more experimental groups 

Independent Variables - The factor that is manipulated
Dependent Variables - The factor that in (possibly) influenced by the Independent Variable

There are always bias; the best of us cannot help but insert our values into the interpretation.

### Ethics

We prioritize human health and happiness over that of animals. But what is the right balance?

The APA recommends that scientists:
* Obtain informed consent,
* Make efforts to protect their subjects from pain or discomfort
* Keep identifying information confidential, and
* Debrief.

# Psychobiology

There is a biological reason for everything psychological.

In order to understand a system, you need a more complicated system. Therefore, it's hard to understand the brain with the brain.

"I think therefore I am"
* Meaning if we are in the Matrix, you'd still exist

The fundamental unit is the nervous system with the cell the fundamental unit of that.

## Neuron
**Neuron**: A nerve cell. A cell with a synapse.

We say a cell is hyper polarized if it is *more negative* than usual

We say a cell is depolarized if it is *less* negative than usual*

The language of neurons is both electric and biological.

### Synapse

The neurotransmitter acts like a "key" with special chemical "locks" called receptors.

### Neurotransmitters

Acetylcholine (ACh)
* Handles movement

Morphine
* Alleviating pain and inducing euphoria

Synthetic Neurotransmitter
* Creating artificial "keys" to unlock the "lock"
* Either creates an exact key OR close enough to jam the lock so the real key can't get in

## Nervous System

Central Nervous System (CNS)
* The brain and the spine
Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)
* Everything else

Nerves are bundles of axons

Nerves
* Sensory
    * Carry messages from the sense organs to the brain or spine for processing
* Motor
* Carry signals from the CNS to the muscles and organs
* Interneurons
    * These are all those neurons between sensory and motor neurons (most neurons are interneurons)

### PNS: Somatic Nervous System
The somatic nervous system  in the concious part -- you have concious control (ex. Limbs).

### ANS: Automatic Nervous System
Unconscious functions (ex. Heart rate). However, this is a fuzzy line.

### CNS: Central Nervous System
"You" are your brain 

"Ascending" signals are signals to the brain
"Descending" signals are from the brain

### The Endocrine System
It "sets the tone"

Signals set by the endocrine system linger in the blood explains why feelings linger.

## The Brain


<div style='width: 90%' class='ui rounded images'>
<img class='ui image' src='./psyc1101/lec3-fig3.png'>
</div>


### The Old Brain
Instinctual impulses. We call it the old brain because it is present in (most) other animals.
* Breathing
* Heart-rate
* etc.

### The Limbic System 
* The amygdala (Very important)
    * Handles fear and emotions
* The hypothalamus - reward center of the brain. Activated, rats will pass out pushing a lever to stimulate the hypothalamus.
    * Thirst 
    * Hunger
    * and Sexual behavior

## The New Brain
Handles conciousness


### The Cerebellum ("The Little Brain")
Handles motor functions

### The Cerebral Cortex

**Frontal Lobe**: Planning and thinking through actions

We know what certain parts of the brain by case studying of people who are missing that part of the brain.

For example, the frontal lobe is connected with planning and emotions.

Motor cortex, sensory cortex

**Association Areas**:

More than $\frac{3}{4}$th of the cortex is *not* one of those regions that receives direct sensory input or sends motor output. These areas are called *association areas*.


**Visual and Auditory Cortex**: Handles audio and visuals in a very organized manner


### Brain-Computer Interfaces
By using EEG, fMRI, or implanted electrodes, we can "eavesdrop" into what's going on inside a living person's brain.

---
The first writing assignment is due next Wednesday (February 3rd)
* Which movie is funnier, *Airplane!* or *The Holy Grail?*.
* Imagine a research project that you could conduct yourself
* What is your operational definition of funny
    * For this purpose of this project, this means funny

1. Explain the problem to be addressed
2. Operationalize the variables under study, and
3. Outline the statistical approach that will be used to test the hypothesis.

### Plasticity

Describes the ability of the CNS to change as a result of insult or experience 

Plasticity underpins the observation that the blind may appear to have keener hearing than the sighted.

Similarly, if a blind person reads braille with one finger, the part of the brain used for vision is not used for that finger.

Conclusion:
* Use it or lose it
    * If you don't use a certain part of your brain, it will take on a different purpose

### The Divided Brain

**The Right Brain**: is more so the animal brain -- not very good at logic. Ex. Artistic creativity.

**The Left Brain**: More logic focused

Our brain is split and information is processed through the **corpus callosum**.

People with severed corpus callosum's are given a screen to look at that says "HE*ART".
* When asked to speak (left side processes) the word, they said "ART"
* When asked to point at the word (right side process), they pointed at "HE"

### Language 

Reading, writing, speaking, singing. All are language skills.

**Broca's Area**
* In the frontal lobe, is critical for speech generation.

**Wernicke's Area**
In the temporal lobe, is essential for generation cohererent speech 

**The Angular Gyrus**:
* In the parietal lobe, is requires for the processing of auditory input

## The Nervous System II

People with isolated damage to the brain can 'see' without being aware of the sight.
* You can respond to things without being *aware* of them

**Parallel processing**: What your brain handles on its own (ex. Going for a walk.)

**Serial Processing**: Your concious thought (ex. 5+12)

Attention -- serial processing -- is selective. You can only focus on one thing at once.
* It's hard to split your attention
* Ex. With gorilla basketball experiment

### Cognitive Blindness 
The gorilla basketball experiment and distracted driving are cases of *inattentional* blindness.

**Change bias**: The idea that the brain can miss seemingly obvious, big changes.
* Switching experiment instructors and people didn't notice that they were two different people

### Circadian Rhythm and Sleep

The SCN is our 'biological clock' that regulates your alertness and sleep

Before the age of 20, we are night owls

After 20, we are early birds

Falling asleep is actually an instantaneous process -- there is no 'half asleep'.

Here are the stages of sleep:

<div style='width: 90%' class='ui rounded images'>
<img class='ui image' src='./psyc1101/lec5-fig1.png'>
</div>

Here are the stages throughout the night:

<div style='width: 90%' class='ui rounded images'>
<img class='ui image' src='./psyc1101/lec5-fig2.png'>
</div>

The light bulb messes up our *circadian rhythm*.

Throughout our lives, our sleep changes:

<div style='width: 90%' class='ui rounded images'>
<img class='ui image' src='./psyc1101/lec5-fig3.png'>
</div>

**REM rebound**:

After sleep depravation, people have more REM sleep once they get sleep, indicating that it is the most important stage.

**Sleep Loss**

20% of high school students say that they fall asleep in class at least once a week

~60% of high school and college students are sleep deprived

Risks of lack of sleep:
* Shorter life
* Higher blood pressure
* Less stress
* Etc.

You also perform better driving.

**Insomnia**: Is the *persistent* difficulty with falling or staying asleep. Drugs and alcohol is bad to self-medicate. Instead try:
* Exercise,
* Cutting back on caffeine, 
* Turning down the lights
* Practicing relaxation 

**Apnea**: A period, up to a minute, where sleepers fail to breathe. They are then "jerked" awake by snoring.

**Narcolepsy**: The sufferer is overcome by overwhelming sleepiness. They often occur at very inopportune times, such as after exerting oneself by
* Laughing
* Playing sports
* Etc.

**Night Terrors**: Disease of children. Young children will awaken, talk incoherently and experience rapid heart and breathing rates. Typically, they do not remember anything in the morning. They are not in REM sleep which means that they are not dreams.

**Sleepwalking/talking**: Sleepwalkers are also usually children. It is genetic. They are also not typically acting out their dreams.

### Dreams

We now know when someone is dreaming (during REM sleep).

* After a trauma, people tend to have nightmares. 
* Musicians dream frequently of music. 

We are not concious when we dream, our unconscious minds are still running.

People are still aware of things that are going on:
* Spraying someone with mist will often cause them to dream about water

Dreams do *not* act as metaphors for our life's problems.

We often rehearse the things that we did throughout the day in our dreams.

The amygdala determines and holds what is emotionally important.

Dreams are the result of our brain's 'housekeeping' at night.

## Psychoactive Drugs

People who drink more, *can* drink more. This is because people develop **tolerance**.

As tolerance increase, people increase their dose (to get the same result). As you increase your tolerance, you experience withdraws. 

**Dependence**:

There are two different dependencies: physical and psychological. As the name implies, physical dependencies cause physical discomfort.

We may be dependent on many things:
* Smartphones
* Exercise
* Sex
* Work
* etc.

But these aren't *addictions*. We shouldn't overstate or understate the dangers of drugs. Addictive substances aren't necessarily going to ruin you. People also overcome addiction very frequently. There are more ex-smokers than smoking.

But addiction is still the leading cause of accidental death in the US.

There are three different types of drugs:
* Depressants
* Stimulants 
* Hallucinogenics 

**Depressants**:

Most common depressant is alcohol. The first thing to go is your frontal lobe -- effects of reasoning. Slows down your body -- slows down the fight-or-flight.

You forget what happens when you are drunk. When you are drunk, you can't have REM sleep and therefore you can't store things into your long-term memories. Drinking itself isn't bad, but drinking *can* be dangerous if done unsafely.

Opioids:

Ex: opium, herion, and morphine

If you build a dependence, your body stops making its own.

**Stimulants**:
* Stay awake
* etc.

Caffeine ranks as an #1 in the stimulant category. Withdraw includes headaches.

Meth:

Stopping using meth, you get strong withdrawl symptoms.

Nicotine:

Kills a lot of people per year -- a holocaust worth of people at its peak.

More addictive than heroin or cocaine.

Cocaine:

"Quick high"
* The euphoria lasts about 15 minutes
* By 20 minutes, the user becomes agitated.

It blocks the reuptake of dopamine so it stays in the synapse.

Ecstasy: 

Very deadly

**Hallucinogens**:

LSD:

Distorts perceptions and evokes sensory images in the absence of sensory input.

Marijuana:

People often don't get high on the first hit.

# The Mind

What is the mind?

What is consciousness? 
* It's not fixed -- you can become unconscious 

The most important question in psychology and biology is *why*?

We have *two minds*:
* the one we are aware on, and
* the one we are not

Our conciousness does not make decisions. Our ideas are merely rationalized *post hoc*. 

D.F. Lost her concious sight, but could still see -- she moved out of the way of objects.
