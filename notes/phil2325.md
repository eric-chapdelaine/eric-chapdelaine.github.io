# The Class

We will focus on the 5th (and 4th) Century BCE in Athens

Most of the writing in going to be Reflections (good faith)
* 500 words each

Papers (3 x 750 words)

During this time, Greece had what we may consider to be the beginning of a democracy (and therefore politics). Before then, there were rulers. 

What does politics look like when the individuals are part of the process?

Our traditions of self-rule date back to the time period that we will be focusing on.
* What does it mean to live in a community with one-another?
* What does it mean to be a (good) citizen?

One answer is "whatever makes people like you". But there is a difference between what people think and the goodness of you.

We want to understand the thought process of Plato and Aristotle

**Community**

Security is a big part of a community.
* Economic security
* Emotional security

Also has a sense of purpose.

There is intimacy.

Tomorrow we will be looking at the 3 basic roots of ancient Greek politics.

# Democracy, Rhetoric, and Philosophy

## Homer, Hesiod, Solon 

**Homer**: was referred to as the author of the Iliad and the Odyssey. He probably wasn't a real person. Troy and the battle of Troy did exist, however.

Odyssey and the island of the cyclopes:
* Cyclopes are living a non-Greek life. Displayed as a bad way to live.
    * They live in a place where Pandora's box has not been open, fire (progress) has not been given
* No governing body -- no community. Each person has their own laws. The state of nature.
    * They are missing a sense of identity -- they are missing happiness.
    * Care beyond the family does not exist
* They are static. There is no progress. This is a problem to the Greeks.
    * Progress is a double-edged sword
    * War is the natural result of the progress of civilization.
    * With the Greeks, there isn't a civilization to go back to. Now that we have society, we are stuck with it.

**Hesiod**: The common sense way that the Greeks govern. Was interested in how humanity falls short.

The human condition:

* The drive to disguise themselves brings about greatness
* Humans are half animal and half God.
* How can you move forward when you know that you are going to fail? You can't win, but there can be local victories.

*themis*: something that holds together a body/community.
* Some kind of commitment to a collective enterprise holds it together.

What role does the themis play here?
* We need to organize ourselves as much as possible. We need to seek the common ground. 
* Giving us the ability to have communities

The Greeks believed that left to their our devices (that is, no order), civilization would turn into chaos. 
* There will been rich and poor people
* The rich will get greedy and the poor will rise up
* Then, the new power in place will turn into a tyrant and the cycle repeats

A community is built with work. Love is not found, it is made. Familial ties naturally fall apart.

**Solon**: One of the 7th sages of the ancient world. Some time in the 6th century. Laid down the framework for what would be the democracy. How can people live together in peace?

The way to deal with this problem, we need good government.

You need some common ground between the classes. Have them part of the same whole.

Solon had a land-reform policy.

Solon canceled all of the debts so that the poor aren't enslaved to the rich. But he didn't redistribute land as to not start a war.

The government's role is to maintain some common ground.
* There were about 8,000 people who made important political decisions (to have a lot of people represented)

You could live in a city, but not be a citizen.
