# The Class

We will focus on the 5th (and 4th) Century BCE in Athens

Most of the writing in going to be Reflections (good faith)
* 500 words each

Papers (3 x 750 words)

During this time, Greece had what we may consider to be the beginning of a democracy (and therefore politics). Before then, there were rulers. 

What does politics look like when the individuals are part of the process?

Our traditions of self-rule date back to the time period that we will be focusing on.
* What does it mean to live in a community with one-another?
* What does it mean to be a (good) citizen?

One answer is "whatever makes people like you". But there is a difference between what people think and the goodness of you.

We want to understand the thought process of Plato and Aristotle

**Community**

Security is a big part of a community.
* Economic security
* Emotional security

Also has a sense of purpose.

There is intimacy.

Tomorrow we will be looking at the 3 basic roots of ancient Greek politics.

# Democracy, Rhetoric, and Philosophy

## Homer, Hesiod, Solon 

**Homer**: was referred to as the author of the Iliad and the Odyssey. He probably wasn't a real person. Troy and the battle of Troy did exist, however.

Odyssey and the island of the cyclopes:
* Cyclopes are living a non-Greek life. Displayed as a bad way to live.
    * They live in a place where Pandora's box has not been open, fire (progress) has not been given
* No governing body -- no community. Each person has their own laws. The state of nature.
    * They are missing a sense of identity -- they are missing happiness.
    * Care beyond the family does not exist
* They are static. There is no progress. This is a problem to the Greeks.
    * Progress is a double-edged sword
    * War is the natural result of the progress of civilization.
    * With the Greeks, there isn't a civilization to go back to. Now that we have society, we are stuck with it.

**Hesiod**: The common sense way that the Greeks govern. Was interested in how humanity falls short.

The human condition:

* The drive to disguise themselves brings about greatness
* Humans are half animal and half God.
* How can you move forward when you know that you are going to fail? You can't win, but there can be local victories.

*themis*: something that holds together a body/community.
* Some kind of commitment to a collective enterprise holds it together.

What role does the themis play here?
* We need to organize ourselves as much as possible. We need to seek the common ground. 
* Giving us the ability to have communities

The Greeks believed that left to their our devices (that is, no order), civilization would turn into chaos. 
* There will been rich and poor people
* The rich will get greedy and the poor will rise up
* Then, the new power in place will turn into a tyrant and the cycle repeats

A community is built with work. Love is not found, it is made. Familial ties naturally fall apart.

**Solon**: One of the 7th sages of the ancient world. Some time in the 6th century. Laid down the framework for what would be the democracy. How can people live together in peace?

The way to deal with this problem, we need good government.

You need some common ground between the classes. Have them part of the same whole.

Solon had a land-reform policy.

Solon canceled all of the debts so that the poor aren't enslaved to the rich. But he didn't redistribute land as to not start a war.

The government's role is to maintain some common ground.
* There were about 8,000 people who made important political decisions (to have a lot of people represented)

You could live in a city, but not be a citizen.

Personal Reflection

Not graded as a paper

500 words

Hit on one specific thing that you want to say about the idea of being a citizen.
* Have some structure to it

---

The main focus of the Greeks was community.
* What makes something a community and not just a group?
    * They would answer with some common purpose (making life better for future generations)

Humans thrive in community

We are driven by curiosity and progress
* But that also leads to war

The role of government is to help mitigate some of these problems
* Conflict between classes
* The different classes don't view themselves at part of the same community
    * The government's goal is to have each of the classes feel part of the same whole

### Democracy and Rhetoric

The Greek's solution to this was democracy

**How the Greek democracy works**:
* Assembly
    * Main legislative body
    * 10 meetings a year
        * debated all of the issues of the city
        * Can be attended by any citizen (a few thousand people would attend)
        * Decided on majority rule
        * Anyone can speak (chaos)
* Boule
    * Would set the agenda of the assembly
* Court
    * Jury would decide after hearing both parties
* Arcon
    * Chief magistrate
    * Head of states

Athens is a shipping port so it attracts a lot of people. Young ambitious people would go there to make a name for themselves. Rule was not determined by families -- that is, anyone who can make a nice speech can make it a long way.
* This creates a demand for those who claim to teach how to present
* Someone has to write the speeches in the court

Because of this, there was a rethinking of education (in middle or upper classes) in this time.
* You'd learn how to write, math, flute, wrestle
* Then there was a wholistic view of education. How to be seen as a good person/write speeches.

Protagoras
* You might think that governing should be handled by the experts, but that's not how people from Athens think about it
* Politics does not require specialized knowledge
    * Not just voting, but also making (serious) decisions

Should only specialized people work in policy? Should everyone have equal say?
* Having background in a particular thing may help you form policy, but it will affect all parts of the population in different ways.

Why do you teach morals if everything has it?
* "Intelligence is distributed equally, but people use it differently"
    * Everyone can tell if two notes don't go together, but it takes someone good with music can tell you why
    * Everyone has access to the what, education can provide the why
* Everyone has thought on how the world should work (priorities), but they don't know how to bring that out (they can learn this via education) 

This kind of democracy is open and dangerous
* If you know how to speak, people will listen (even if you don't know what your talking about or are doing this for selfish motives)

A good speech binds your will as if you are being physically moved. A good speech can be in favor of anything.
* You can be convinced of something if even you don't think the thing is true
* You often are willing to suspend what you believe to hear someone else out


Socrates was executed for not believing in the gods of the city and corrupting the youth
* He stated that it didn't matter because there were a ton of people that would take his place
* Plato, Socrates student, starts the first university in the world (The Academy)
