# The Class

Does not collect homework, however, the quizzes build off the homework
assignments. Some sections--about 5--of the homework will be collected and make up of the
5%. Will be graded for completeness.

First quiz will be next Wednesday (the 27th)

This class has a midterm and a final

# Rates of Change and the Derivative

## Average Rate of Change
**Example 1:**
<div style='width: 100%' class='ui rounded images'>
<img class='ui image' src='./math1341/lec_1_ex.svg'>
</div>

What is the (average) velocity during the 2 min?
$\text{avg v} = \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta t} = \frac{1\text{mile}}{\frac{1}{30}h} =
30 mph?$

Speedometer: instantaneous velocity 

We will be the average rate of change to approximate the instantaneous rate of
change.

AROC (average rate of change) for $f$ with respect to (wrt) $x$ between $x=a$
and $x=b$ or interval $[a,b]$ where $a<b$.

$\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$ 

This is called the *difference quotient*.

**Example 2:**

At times $t=0,\ 1\ 5$ hours, the car is moving  $v=30,\ 60,\ 40\ mph$
respectively  what are the accelerations between $[0,1],\ [0,5],\ [1,5]$?

**Recall**: Average acceleration  $= \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$

$[0,1]\ a_1=\frac{v(1)-v(0)}{1-0}= \frac{60-30}{1} = 30mph$ 

$[0,5]\ a_2 = \frac{v(5)-v(0)}{5-0} = \frac{40-30}{5-0} = 2mph$ 

$[1,5]\ a_3 = \frac{v(5)-v(1)}{5-1} = \frac{40-60}{5-1} = \frac{-20}{4} = -5mph$

**Example 3:**

What is the AROC of area, $A$, in in$^2$ of 16:9 widescreen TV wrt the
diagonal? $d$ (diagonal) between d=32 in d=40in and 40in and 52in?

To solve this, we want $A(d)$ 

Then we will find $\frac{\Delta A}{\Delta d}$

$A = 16x \times 9x = 337x^{2}$

$(9x)^{2}+(16x)^{2} = d^{2}$
 
$\therefore 337x^{2} = d^{2}$
 
$A(d) = \frac{144}{337}d^{2}$
