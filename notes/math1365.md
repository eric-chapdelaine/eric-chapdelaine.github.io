# Introduction and Fundamentals

## Definitions, Theorems, and Proofs
Mathematical Reasoning: Rigorous math based on logic

**Statement**: Declarative sentence that has a definite truth value

3 Types of Statements

1. Definition: Gives precise meaning. Always true.
2. Theorem: Have to prove to be true (8 is an even number).
3. Proof: Logical arguments to show a theorem is true

Proposition (more modest than theorem) = result. Another word is fact.

**Undefined terms/Axioms**: Don't need to explicit state in proof.
1. Numbers: Integer, Real Number (We will define even, odd, rational, etc.)
2. Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. (We will prove even + even = even)
3. Basic Properties of Arithmetic
4. Ordering of Real Numbers

When in doubt, prove it (or ask).

## Logical Connectives

<div class="note-block">
<strong class="note-block">NOTE:</strong>

The rows of a truth table can be determined by $2^{\text{number of compnent statements}}$
</div>


### Not

Takes one *component statement*

Notation: $\sim p$

Truth Table:

| $p$ | $\sim p$ |
|-----|----------|
| T   | F        |
| F   | T        |


### And

Conjunction

Takes 2 component statements 

Notation: $p \wedge q$

Truth Table:

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \wedge q$ |
|-----|-----|--------------|
| T   | T   | T            |
| T   | F   | F            |
| F   | T   | F            |
| F   | F   | F            |


### Or

Disjunction

Takes 2 component statements

Notation: $p \vee q$

Truth Table:

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \vee q$ |
|-----|-----|------------|
| T   | T   | T          |
| T   | F   | T          |
| F   | T   | T          |
| F   | F   | F          |

### If then

Conditional statement

Another way to say it is $p$ implies $q$.
* In this case, $p$ is the condition/hypothesis/premise/assumption and $q$ is the conclusion.

Truth Table:

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \rightarrow q$ |
|-----|-----|-------------------|
| T   | T   | T                 |
| T   | F   | F                 |
| F   | T   | T                 |
| F   | F   | T                 |

<div class="note-block">
<strong class="note-block">Warning:</strong>

It doesn't say anything about the condition when $\sim p$ is true.
</div>

$p \rightarrow q$
* Inverse: $\sim p \rightarrow \sim q$
* Converse: $q \rightarrow p$

Note, the inverse and the converse have the same truth table and therefore they are the same.

### if and only if

Also called iff or biconditional

Notation: $p \leftrightarrow q$
* = $(p \rightarrow q) \wedge (q \rightarrow p)$
* = $(p \rightarrow q) \wedge (\sim p \rightarrow \sim q)$ 

Truth Table:

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \leftrightarrow q$ |
|-----|-----|-----------------------|
| T   | T   | T                     |
| T   | F   | F                     |
| F   | T   | F                     |
| F   | F   | T                     |

<div class="note-block">
<strong class="note-block">NOTE:</strong>

All definitions are bidirectional. That is, if a definition has "if ... then", it means "if and only if".
