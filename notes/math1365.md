# Introduction and Fundamentals

## Definitions, Theorems, and Proofs
Mathematical Reasoning: Rigorous math based on logic

**Statement**: Declarative sentence that has a definite truth value

3 Types of Statements

1. Definition: Gives precise meaning. Always true.
2. Theorem: Have to prove to be true (8 is an even number).
3. Proof: Logical arguments to show a theorem is true

Proposition (more modest than theorem) = result. Another word is fact.

**Undefined terms/Axioms**: Don't need to explicit state in proof.
1. Numbers: Integer, Real Number (We will define even, odd, rational, etc.)
2. Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. (We will prove even + even = even)
3. Basic Properties of Arithmetic
4. Ordering of Real Numbers

When in doubt, prove it (or ask).
