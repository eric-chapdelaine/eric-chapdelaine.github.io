# Introduction to Java

Data. We first started with *atomic data*. 

For example:

```scheme
;; a PosReal number representing the price of a coffee
(define coffee-price 3.5)
(define fancy-coffee (+ coffee-price 1.5))
(define extra-fancy-cofee (+ coffee-price "2 dollars")) 
; This won't work. Can't add number to integer.

;; An Auto is a (make-auto Integar Integar String PosReal)
(define-struct auto (x y color speed))
```
DrRacket doesn't know that this is wrong until you run it. `Auto` is an example
of compound data--meaning it holds multiple values.

This code would not have *compiled*.

Java is a **strongly typed language** (data is checked at compile time). And ISL
is **dynamically typed** (data is checked at run time).

## Java Variables
In Java there are two types of numbers: Integers and Doubles. (There are more,
but we only care about these 2 for now.)

Also, you can't have dashes in Java's names--instead use camelCase.
Example in Java:
```java
// Primative Types
int distance = 3;
double coffeePrice = 3.5;
String hi = "hello";
char a = 'a';
boolean isSunny = false;
```

Why is String capitalized? Because it is not a primitive data type. 

## Compound Data in Java
### Example - Auto

<div style='width: 100%' class='ui rounded images'>
<img class='ui image' src='./cs2510/autodiag.svg'>
</div>





```java
class Auto {
    //int x;
    //int y;
    Location loc;
    String color;
    double speed;
    //Auto(int x, int y, String color, double speed){ // This is a constructor
    Auto(Location loc, String color, double speed){
        //this.x = x; // _this_ means the one in the class
        //this.y = y;
        this.loc = loc;
        this.color = color;
        this.speed = speed;
    }
}
class Location{
    int x;
    int y;
    Location(int x, int y){
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}
class ExamplesAuto{
    Location Loc34 = new Location(3, 4);
    Auto car1 = new Auto(Loc34, "red", 50.0);
    ExamplesAuto(){}
}

```

# Unions

### Example - Spaceships


<div style='width: 100%' class='ui rounded images'>
<img class='ui image' src='./cs2510/space-ship-example.png'>
</div>

**Racket**:
```scheme
(define-struct invader (loc color bullets size))
;; An Invader is a (make-invader Posn String PosInt PosInt

(define invader1 (make-invader (make-posn 60 120) "green" 30 3))

#;(define (invader-temp1 inv)
    (posn-temp1 (invader-loc inv))
    (invader-color inv)
    (invader-bullets inv)
    (invader-size inv))

(define-struct ship (loc color speed))
;; A Shapeship is a (make-ship Posn String PosInt)
;; interp.: loc is a position on the Cartesian plane
;; speed is measured in miles/hour
    

;; A GamePiece is one of:
;; - Spaceship
;; - Invader

```

NOTE: The Union data type is only in comments in DrRacket. In Java, however,
this is not in comments.

**Java**
```java
interface IGamePiece {};

// Represents an Invader in the game
class Spaceship implements IGamePiece {
    Location loc
    String color;
    int speed;
    Spaceship(Location loc, String color, int speed){
        this.loc = loc;
        this.color = color;
        this.speed = speed;
    }
}

// Represents an Invader in the game
class Invader implements IGamePiece {
    Location loc
    String color;
    int bullets;
    int size;
    Invader(Location loc, String color, int bullets, int size){
        this.loc = loc;
        this.color = color;
        this.bullets = bullets;
        this.size = size;
    }
}

// A class to represent a location on the Cartesian plane
class Location {
    int x;
    int y;
    Location(int x, int y){
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}

class Examples {
    // You cant do the line below because it doesn't know what loc1 is yet
    //Spaceship ship = new Spaceship(this.loc1, "blue", 55);
    
    Location loc1 = new Location(30, 40);
    Location loc2 = new Location(60, 80);
    // Represents two IGamePieces: Spaceships and Invaders
    IGamePiece ship = new Spaceship(this.loc1, "blue", 55);
    IGamePiece invader1 = new Invader(this.loc2, "pink", 30, 3);
    
    // You can still do this, but it's bad practice
    //Spaceship ship = new Spaceship(new Location(30, 40), "blue", 55); 
    
}
    
```

`IGamePiece` is the type at compile time

`Spaceship/Invader` is the type at run-time

Use the `this` keyword anytime you can--it removes ambiguity.

In Java, Unions are **interfaces**. The reason we would want to declare a
variable by it's Union is so it can be that type--which means that we can use
more general operations.

### Example - Ancestor Tree

**Racket**:
```racket
;; A Person is a (make-person String Person Person)
(define-struct person (name mom dad))

(define alice (make-person "Alice" 
                (make-person "Sally"
                    (make-person "Abby"
                        ...
; this issue with this definition is that you cannot stop--you need a base case
; for referential data

;; An AT is one of:
;; - #false
;; - (make-person String AT AT)
```

<div style='width: 100%' class='ui rounded images'>
<img class='ui image' src='./cs2510/fam-tree-ex-lec-2.png'>
</div>

**Java**:
```java
interface IAT{}

// Class to represent an unknown in an ancestor tree
class Unknown implements IAT {
    Unknown() {}
}

// Class to represent a person in an ancestor tree
class Person implements IAT {
    String name;
    int yob
    IAT mom;
    IAT dad;
    
    Person(String name, int yob, IAT mom, IAT dad) {
    this.name = name;
    this.yob = yob;
    this.mom = mom;
    this.dad = dad;
    }
}
```
