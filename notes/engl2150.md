# The Class

The Cannon wars: the idea that we usually only read material from white men

What does it mean to broaden whose voices we hear.
* The more inclusive that is, the more just the world is 

The digital world wold *algorithm bias* as it represents the biases of the past.

The 3 Units of the Class:
* Exploration of 'Text Encoding' (very close reading)
* Text analysis 
    * we will be using the programming language `R` for machine learning
* Digital archive creation

# The Tempest

[Online Text](https://shakespeare.folger.edu/shakespeares-works/the-tempest/act-1-scene-1/)

Class is very huge in this society--they are *not* equals.
* It starts off with a dispute between the aristocrats and the workers

In the beginning of the book, there are different ideas of authority
* The workers see themselves as more powerful because they have the power to save the ship
* The aristocrats see themselves are more powerful because they are higher class
