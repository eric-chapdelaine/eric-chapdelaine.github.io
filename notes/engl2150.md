# The Class

The Cannon wars: the idea that we usually only read material from white men

What does it mean to broaden whose voices we hear.
* The more inclusive that is, the more just the world is 

The digital world wold *algorithm bias* as it represents the biases of the past.

The 3 Units of the Class:
* Exploration of 'Text Encoding' (very close reading)
* Text analysis 
    * we will be using the programming language `R` for machine learning
* Digital archive creation

# The Tempest

## Text Encoding

How has the text evolved from when it was originally written to the online version?

The production of our Tempest edition
* 1611 play is performed, circulates in manuscript 
* 1623 First Folio
* Print Folger editions (synthetic)
* TEI edition
* Web edition


## Context
Inspired by a true ship reck 

**The Great Chain of Being:** Represents the hierarchy of things during the time of Shakespeare
* God
* Angles
* Humans
* Beast
* Plant
* Flame
* Stone

### Act i, Scene i

Class is very huge in this society--they are *not* equals.
* It starts off with a dispute between the aristocrats and the workers

In the beginning of the book, there are different ideas of authority
* The workers see themselves as more powerful because they have the power to save the ship
* The aristocrats see themselves are more powerful because they are higher class

### Act ii, Scene ii

Magic is introduced

## Gender in The Tempest

Why was Miranda's virginity so important throughout this play?
* Virginity -- and general purity -- were seen as valuable during the time
* Possibility 

Marriage was more of a transaction instead of falling in love (as it is today)

    * The 'play' of the engagement represents Prospero's power
* Caliban, Trinculo, and Stephino are drunk and trying to act out their plans to kill Prospero

Act 5, Scene 1
* Prospero forgives all and breaks his wand and drowns his books.


# TEI Text-encoding

TEI is a particular flavor that describes how to use XML to fit their standards.

Stripping down the document to the bare bones
* But removes the ambiguity 

**Model**: Useful distortion so that something can be studied (We need to cut information to make something practical)

### What is XML?

Governing the rules for elements -- looks similar to HTML.

Elements have start tags `<...>` and end tags `</...>`

Examples: `<speaker name="Bob">` 
* Attributes: `name`
* Name: `speaker`

**Metadata**: Data about the data itself
* Examples: Publication date, title, etc.

## TEI
Has a header (holds meta data)

Has the text (has the body of the document)
* Required to have a body

```xml
<teiHeader>
...
</teiHeader>
<text>
    <body>
        ...
    </body>
</text>
```

**Example**:
```xml
    <head>EPILOGVE,</head>
      <sp>       
         <stage type="delivery">spoken by <persName>Prospero</persName>.</stage>
      <lg rhyme="abababa"><l>NOw my Charmes are all <rhyme>ore-throwne</rhyme>,</l>
      <l>And what strength I <choice><orig>haue's</orig><reg>have's</reg></choice> mine owne.</l>
      <l>Which is most faint: now 'tis true</l>
      <l>I must be heere confinde by you,</l>
      <l>Or sent to <placeName>Naples</placeName>, Let me not</l>
      <l>Since I haue my Dukedome got,</l>
      <l>And pardon'd the deceiuer, dwell</l>
      <l>In this bare Island, by your Spell,</l>
      <l>But release me from my bands</l>
      <l>With the helpe of your good hands:</l>
      <l>Gentle breath of yours, my Sailes</l>
      <l>Must fill, or else my proiect failes,</l>
      <l>Which was to please: Now I want</l>
      <l>Spirits to enforce: Art to inchant,</l>
      <l>And my ending is despaire,</l>
      <l>Vnlesse I be relieu'd by praier</l>
      <l>Which pierces so, that it assaults</l>
      <l>Mercy it selfe, and frees all faults.</l>
      <l>As you from crimes would pardon'd be,</l>
      <l>Let your Indulgence set me free.</l></lg> <stage type="exit">Exit.</stage></sp>
```

Whenever you want to tell TEI the alignment of the text, use the attribute `style` (CSS).

Example:

```xml
<p style="text-align:center">Some text here. </p>
<p style="text-align:right; font-size:italic">More text here.</p>
```
