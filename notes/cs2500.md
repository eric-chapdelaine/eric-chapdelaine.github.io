# Lecture 1 - Introduction

**What is Computer Science?**

- Telling a computer what to do
- The science behind how computers run
- Problem solving

Computer science is to computers as microscopes are to biology.

This course is about how to solve problems, NOT how to use the tools to solve problems. Learning universal computer science and not the tools.

## The Course

The course website is on canvas

- You need a Khoury College account
- We will be using Piazza

**Piazza:**

- Announcements
- Wiki for the class
- Questions and Answers

**Homework:**

- Due Friday evenings (but should be done Thursday)
- Check all homework on Canvas

## Rules of Evaluation

Like the order of operations but for computer science

### Syntax of Arithmetic

$$12 + 6-$$

This is an example of incorrect syntax

### Semantics / Meaning

Shows how to go from a valid arithmetic expression to an answer.

$$5 \times 7 + \frac{21}{3}$$

Why does this equal 42?

- Order of operations (Rules of Evaluation)

**Breakdown:**

$$35 + \frac{21}{3}$$

$$35+7=42$$

**Example:**

$$3x-2$$

Can't tell what this is yet because it's not complete

Let $x=8$

Now it is 22 (because $3(8) -2=22$)

# Lecture 2 - Intro to Dr Racket and Image Manipulation

## Homework

Do the assigned reading before the week (lightly). Once the lecture is over, go back and read the book.

How to read a technical book:

You can't read it as a 'normal' book. Type along with the examples. Try out different variations of the presented code

## DrRacket

Use the 'Beginning Student Language'

Recall:

- 1+2*4 â†’(+ 1 (* 2 4))
    - This makes the order of operations obvious
- Strings have to wrapped in double quotations

Dr Racket is split up into two panels, the top one is used for code that you want to keep and the bottom one can be thought of as interactive (it runs each line when you hit enter)

### String Manipulation

```scheme
(replicate 10 "hi ")
; "hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi "
```

### Image Manipulation

Import Library:

```scheme
(require 2htdp/image)
(circle 10 "solid" "red") ; returns a solid, red circle of radius 10
(rectange 300 200 "outline" "blue") ; Returns rectangle width 300,
												;height 200
```

Other Functions of Images

```scheme
(beside [image1] [image2])
(overlay [image1] [image2])
```

NOTE: Both of these functions return an image (you can nest these functions)

**place-image**

```scheme
(place-image IMAGE x y scene) ; see documentation for more
```

NOTE: The origin point is the top left corner

Example:

```scheme
; Create an image of a setting sun with a blue background
(circle 30 "solid" "yellow") ; sun
(rectangle 300 200 "solid" "blue") ; sky

(place-image (circle 10 "solid" "yellow") 40 50
						(rectangle 400 200 "solid" "blue")
```

This code is ugly and doesn't represent how humans think about. We assign names to things. For example `(circle 10 "solid" "yellow")` is the `sun`. To do this, we use the `define` function.

Example:

```scheme
(define SUN (circle 10 "solid" "yellow"))
(define SKY (rectangle 400 200 "solid" "blue"))

(place-image SUN 300 500 SKY)
```

## Functions

What is a function?

$$f(t)=30 - \frac{1}{2}9.8^{2}$$

This function explains how far an object will have gone `t` seconds after dropping.

There are 3 things abou thtis function

1. The name of the function
2. The argument(s)
3. The body of the function

### DrRacket

`(define ([name] [argument[s]) (body of the function))`

Example:

```scheme
(define ACCEL-BY-GRAVITY 9.8)

(define (free-fall t)
	(- 30 (* (/ 1 2) ACCEL-BY-GRAVITY t t))
```

Example: Example drawing function in DrRacket

```scheme
; Draw a sun with y-point `y`

(define (draw-sun y)
	(place-image SUN 300 y SKY))
```

But what about 'real' animations?

```scheme
; Include draw-sun function from previous example
(require 2htdp/universe)
(animate draw-sun) ; Input a function that will be incremented every
									; tick
```
# Lecture 3 - Conditions and Functions

### Functions

Recall this math equation from [Lecture 2 - Intro to Dr Racket and Image Manipulation](Lecture%202%20-%20Intro%20to%20Dr%20Racket%20and%20Image%20Manipulat%206769d1599dd84aba921baee4d63089f3.md)

$$f(t) = 30 - \frac{1}{2} 9.8^{2}$$

```scheme
; whole program not shown
(define (free-fall t)
	(-30 (* 1/2 ACCEL-BY-GRAVITY t t)))
```

**Solving By Substitution**

Racket replaces all variables by the actual parameter/variable value. If you put in `3` into free-fall, it would handle it as follows

```scheme
(- 30 (* 1/2 9.8 3 3)) = -14.1
```

## Racket

### Numbers in Racket:

Whenever you write $\frac{1}{2}$or $\frac{1}{3}$, you aren't doing the division (the language handles it as a single number). To actually do the division, do `(/ 1 2)`

### Comments

Block Comments: `#| [CODE] |#`

Single Line: `;`

### Check-Expect

Checks return value against an expected value. Shows 'halloween' colors where your code hasn't run in the tests.

```scheme
(check-expect [function with value] [expected value])
```

For example:

```scheme
(check-expect (price->yelp 100) "$$$") ; Returns 'The test passed!'
```

### Stepper

Shows how BSL uses substitiution in its code. Acts as a debugger.

```scheme
$f(t) = 30 - \frac{1}{2} 9.8^{2}$
```

### Booleans

Any yes/no or true/false answer. In BSL, they are represented by `#true` and `#false`

### Predicates

A function that returns a boolean. Usually ends with `?` and it's pronounced 'huh'. Example `string?` is pronounced string-huh?

## Sunset Problem

```scheme
(require 2htdp/image)
(require 2htdp/universe)

(define SUN (circle 10 "solid" "yellow"))
(define SKY (rectangle 200 100 "solid" "blue"))
(define NIGHT-SKY (rectangle 200 100 "solid" "black"))
(define MOON (circle 10 "solid" "gray"))

(place-image 100 33 SUN 100 33 SKY)); Places the SUN in the SKY

(place-image MOON 50 33 (place-image SUN 100 33 SKY)); Places the moon and sun in the sky

;  Places the moon at the given x
; coordinate on an image of the sun and the sky.
; eclipse: Number -> Image
(define (eclipse moon-x)
    (place-image MOON moon-x 33 (place-image SUN 100 33 SKY)))

(animate eclipse); Run and incriment eclipse every `tick'
```

Now let's try to write the eclipse function with a conditional (See later in the lecture for conditionals)

```scheme
;  Places the moon at the given x
; coordinate on an image of the sun and the sky.
; eclipse: Number -> Image
(define (eclipse moon-x)
    (place-image MOON moon-x 33 (place-image SUN 100 33
        (cond
            [ ..to the left.. SKY]
            [ ..covering.. NIGHT-SKY]
            [ ..to the right.. SKY]))))
(animate eclipse); Run and incriment eclipse every `tick'
```

## Conditionals

Goes through the tests until one of them is true, then it runs the corresponding code.

```scheme
(cond
    [test-1 answer-1]
    [test-2 answer-2])
```

Example: `price->yelp`

```scheme
; price->yelp (pronounced "price to yelp")
(define (price-> price)
    (cond
        [(> price 50) "\$\$\$\$"]
        [(> price 30) "\$\$\$"]
        [(> price 15) "\$\$"]
        [(< price 15) "\$"]))
        ; if you don't want the last check,
				;use `else' in the condititon to catch everything else
```
# Lecture 4 - How to Write Functions

From Lecture 3's class:

```scheme
(require 2htdp/image)
(require 2htdp/universe)

(define SUN (circle 25 "solid" "yellow"))
(define MOON (circle 25 "solid" "gray"))
(define SKY (rectangle 200 200 "solid" "light blue"))
(define NIGHT-SKY (rectangle 200 200 "solid" "black"))

; draw-eclipse : Number -> Image
; Draw the moon at the given x-coordinate, on a scene with the
(define (draw-eclipse x-moon)
  (place-image MOON x-moon 100 (place-image SUN 100 100 (cond
                                                          [test-2 SKY]
                                                          [test-2 NIGHT-SKY]))))

(animate draw-eclipse)

```

### Programming Style:

- It doesn't really matter but as long as it's consistant
    - Writing is just a small part of programming
- [https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs2500/style.html](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs2500/style.html) for course style guide

Examples:

- Having really long lines (usually 80 characters; 102 for this course)

```scheme
(cond
  [test-2 SKY]
  [test-2 NIGHT-SKY])

```

Notice how each condition is on its own line and they are properly indented

```scheme
(require 2htdp/image)
(require 2htdp/universe)

(define SUN (circle 25 "solid" "yellow"))
(define MOON (circle 25 "solid" "gray"))
(define SKY (rectangle 200 200 "solid" "light blue"))
(define NIGHT-SKY (rectangle 200 200 "solid" "black"))
(define DARK-SKY (rectangle 200 200 "solid" "blue"))

; draw-eclipse : Number -> Image
; Draw the moon at the given x-coordinate, on a scene with the
(define (draw-eclipse x-moon)
  (place-image
   MOON
   x-moon
   100
   (place-image
    SUN
    100
    100
    (cond
      [(or (< x-moon 50) (> x-moon 150)) SKY]
      [(= x-moon 100) NIGHT-SKY]
      [(<= 50 x-moon 150) DARK-SKY])))) ; between 50 - 100 - 150

(animate draw-eclipse)

```

## How do get started writing functions:

- Function Signatures
- Purpose Statement: Higher level (short) description for what the function does.
- The Function Definition
- The `check-expects`

**Designing Functions:**

- Signature
- Purpose Statement
- Function Definition

**Designing Data:**

- Data Definition
- Interpretation
- Examples

Prompt: Create a function that takes in a numerical grade and returns a letter grade

**Signature**: num->grade : Number -> String
Can be multiple lines to define data types

**Purpose Statement**: Given a numeric grade, produces a letter grade

**Function Template**: Used to copy and paste for similar functions (such as `lettergrade->gpa`, `lettergrade->passing?`)

```scheme
; letter-grade-template : LetterGrade -> ?

#| (define (letter-grade-template lg)
	(cond
	[(string=? lg "A") ...]
	[(string=? lg "B") ...]
	[(string=? lg "C") ...]
	[(string=? lg "D") ...]
	[(string=? lg "F") ...]))
|# ;This is a block comment

```

**Examples (`check-expects`)**: Examples of what inputs lead to what outputs

**The Funtion Body**: the function itself

```scheme
; A NumericGrade is a real number in [0,100]
; Interpretation: A student's numeric grade in Fundies I.

; A LetterGrade is a one of
; - "A"
; - "B"
; - "C"
; - "D"
; - "F" ; An enumerated data definition
; Interpretation: A student's letter grade is Fundies I.

; num->grade : NumericGrade -> LetterGrade
; Given a numeric grade, produces a letter grade
(check-expect (num->grade 93) "A")
(check-expect (num->grade 88) "B")
(check-expect (num->grade 72) "C")
; Unreasonable Examples
(check-expect (num->grade -10) "F")
(check-expect (num->grade 101) "A")

(define (num->grade n)
	(cond
		[(>= n 90) "A"]
		[(>= n 80) "B"]
		[(>= n 70) "C"]
		[(>= n 60) "D"]
		[(< n 40) "F"]))


; A LetterGrade is a one of
; - "A"
; - "B"
; - "C"
; - "D"
; - "F"
; Given a letter grade, determine if it is a passing grade.
; grade->passing? : LetterGrade -> Boolean
(define (grade->passing? lg)
	(cond
	[(string-equals? lg "A") #true]
	[(string-equals? lg "B") #true]
	[(string-equals? lg "C") #true]
	[(string-equals? lg "D") #false]
	[(string-equals? lg "F") #false]))


```

# Lecture 5 - Extended How to Write Functions

### Recap on [Lecture 4 - How to Write Functions](Lecture%204%20-%20How%20to%20Write%20Functions%20f068d9b1c2884de4923c8927ce53740c.md) :

Two things you need to design for a program: - Data - You will rarely need to accept all numbers. Itâ€™s a subset of all real numbers (â„•). Examples of this are GPAâ€™s are between 0 and 4 - Functions

---

### Lecture 5

Example: convert temperature from celcius to fahrenheit

Note: use __VAR__ to represent the variable â€˜VARâ€™ in comments. Essentially quotation marks

```scheme
; Celcius is a Number greater than or equal to -273
; Interpretation: A temperature expressed in celcius.

(define celcius-ex-freezing 0 )
(define celcius-ex-boiling 100)

; celcius-template : Celcius -> ?
(define (celcius-template ctemp)
  (... ctemp ...))
; Not too much info can be given in the template, but use ctemp

; Fahrenheit is a Number greater than or equal to -460
; Interpretation: A tempature expressed in fahrenheit

(define fahrenheit-ex-freezing 32)
(define farhrenheit-ex-boiling 212)

; fahrenheit-template : Fahrenheit -> ?
(define (fahrenheit-template ftemp)
  (... ftemp ...)) ; Not useful now, but just in case fahrenheit is the input

; c->f : Celcius -> Fahrenheit
; Converts the given _ctemp_ in celcius to a
; temperature in fahrenheit.

(check-expect (c->f celcius-ex-freezing) fahrenheit-ex-freezing)
(check-expect (c->f celcius-ex-boiling) farhrenheit-ex-boiling)
(define (c->f ctemp)
  (+ (* (/ 9 5) ctemp) 32))
```

Example 2: Design a traffic light

```scheme
(require 2htdp/image)
; A TrafficLight is a:
; - "Red"
; - "Yellow"
; - "Green"
; Interpretation: The color of the active lightbulb in a standard U.S. traffic light.
(define TL-RED "Red") ; Constants are used to you don't make capitalization mistakes
(define TL-YELLOW "Yellow")
(define TL-GREEN "Green")

; tl-template : TrafficLight -> ?
;(define (tl-template tl)
;  (cond
;    [(string=? tl TL-RED) test-1 ...]
;    [(string=? tl TL-YELLOW) test-2 ...]
;    [(string=? tl TL-GREEN) test-3 ...]))

; Takes a __TrafficLight__ and returns an image of the corresponding light (__TrafficImage__)
; A TrafficImage is a circle with color red, yellow, or green
; draw-traffic-light : TrafficLight -> TrafficImage
(check-expect (draw-light TL-RED) (circle 40 "solid" "red"))

(define (draw-traffic-light tl)
  (circle 40 "solid" tl))

(draw-traffic-light TL-GREEN)

; ran out of time for the signature :/
(define (next-light tl)
  (cond
    [(string=? tl TL-RED) TL-GREEN]
    [(string=? tl TL-YELLOW) TL-RED]
    [(string=? tl TL-GREEN) TL-YELLOW]))

```
# Lecture 6 - Big Bang and Helper Functions

HW 2 - Do with the same partners at HW1

## Recall from [Lecture 5 - Extended How to Write Functions](Lecture%205%20-%20Extended%20How%20to%20Write%20Functions%20aa802bb5a45944bdb0a8f925d6d5de21.md)

Writing a function that handles TrafficLights

Datatype TrafficLight is an `enumerated data list` with three different possible String possibilities

- "Green"
- "Yellow"
- "Red"

Functions:

`next-light` - Given a traffic light, return the next color

- Only three different possible examples. Below is the exhuastive set of examples (which means that it's essentially your function definition)
    - Red â†’Green
    - Yellow â†’Red
    - Green â†’Yellow

### Animation

- Can't use `animate` because it returns an incremented number which isn't compatable with the TrafficLight datatype

so instead we have to use...

### Big-Bang

- More powerful than animate

Example:

```scheme
(big-bang
	TL-RED ; Initial State
	[on-draw draw-light] ; Do this event every tick)
	[on-tick next-light] 0.25) ; What to do every tick (incrementation
	; The 0.25 denotes the rate of animation

```

How Big-Bang works (it requires 2htdp/universe)

1. `on-draw` on initial state
2. `on-tick` creates new scene with given state
3. There can be more event handlers (see documentation for more information)

### Traffic Light Example

Return a full image of traffic light with all colors and have the active on solid (with the others outlined)

### Helper Functions

- A function that simplifies the main function by doing repeatative tasks in a different function

Example:

Draw a TrafficLight bulb with color __tl__ and the corresponding outlined/solid

If you have a `cond` with only two possibilities, use an `if` statement which is structured as follows: `(if (condition) (IF_TRUE) (IF_FALSE))`

```scheme
; Draw a traffic light blub with color _tl_, that is either on or off, depending
; on the color of the active light.
; (string=? tl active-tl)
(define (draw-bulb/v2 tl active-tl)
  (circle
   30
   (if (string=? tl active-tl)
       "solid"
       "outline")
   tl))
```

Full Code from Class:

```scheme
(require 2htdp/image)
(require 2htdp/universe)

; A TrafficLight is a:
; - "Red"
; - "Yellow"
; - "Green"
; Interpretation: The color of the active lightbulb in a standard U.S. traffic light.
(define TL-RED "Red")

  (cond
    [(string=? tl TL-RED) ...]

    [(string=? tl TL-GREEN) ...]))

; A TrafficImage is a circle with color red, yellow, or green

; draw-light : TrafficLight -> Image
; Given a traffic light, produces an image of the traffic light.

# Lecture 7 - Structures

HW: Give at least 3 'interseting' examples

- Have no Halloween colors
- Don't mindlessly tweak numbers

### Data + Examples

- Make sure to test with the number 0

Information vs. Data: Information is the interpretation of data

- **Atomic Data**
    - Strings
    - Booleans
    - Numbers
- **Interals**
    - Ranges of numbers
- **Enumerated Data**
    - ex. TrafficLight
    - Only a certain amount of options (usually a String)
- **Structured Data**
    - Mix of different data types
    - Example: A student at Northeastern
        - First name (String)
        - Last name (String)
        - GPA (Number in range [0.0, 4.0])
        - on-coop (Boolean)

BAD WAY of representing this data:

```scheme
"Jane Doe 3.9 #false"
```

This is bad because it's all in a single string. Someone with a first name with a space in it can break it. For example:

```scheme
"Jin Ho Kim 3.9 #false"
```

## Structures

```scheme
(define-struct student [first last gpa on-coop])
```

Creates 'constructor' function that tkes 4 arguments (which correspond to the 4 inputs)

Example:

```scheme
(make-student "Jin Ho" "Kim" 3.9 #false) ; This is an extual value
```

### Accessor Functions

Accessor functions are also created

```scheme
(student-first example-student-1) ; returns the first name of __example-student-1__
```

Wait! What if we did `(make-student student 0 0 0 0)`, after all, those are four inputs.

This is why we need a good data definition

```scheme
; A GPA is a Number in the range [0.0, 4.0]
; Data definition:
; A student is a _(make-student String String GPA Boolean)_
;
; Interpretation: A _(make-student first last gpa on-coop)_
; represents a student with name _first last_ and GPA _gpa_, and
; _on-coop_ is _#true_ if they are presently on a co-op.
(define-struct student [first last gpa on-coop])
```

### Templates

What does a template for a `student`look like?

```scheme
; student-template : student -> ?
(define (student-template student)
  (... (student-first student) ...
       (student-last student) ...
       (student-gpa student) ...
       (student-on-coop student) ...))
```

## Functions with Structures

You can't change a structure, so functions have to return a different structure.

Example:

```scheme
; toggle-coop : student -> student
; _(toggle-coop s)_ consumes a student _s_ and produces student
; that that is identical to _s_, but with the opposite co-op
; status.
(define (toggle-coop student)
  (make-student
    (student-first student)
    (student-last student)
    (student-gpa student)
    (not (student-on-coop student))))
```

## Example: Ball in motion in two dimensions

```scheme
; Data definition:
; A ball is a (make-ball Real Real Real Real)
; Interpretation:
; A _(make-ball x y vx vy)_ represents a ball at position (x,y)
; moving with velocity (vx, vy).

# Lecture 8 - Extended Structures

Recall from [Lecture 7 - Structures](Lecture%207%20-%20Structures%204757717f3fc74c33ba6367130e541841.md)

Structures are values that you can think of as a box with 'n' number of compartments ('n' is the number of inputs you spesifiy)

**The difference between value and expression**

Value: The data

Expression: A task for the computer to simplify further (ex. `(+ 1 2)`)

NOTE: Values are expressions

- For example, typing `13`, returns `13`

## Structures

`define-struct`

- Only defines constructor functions

`student?` (replace with structure name) is a predicate that returns if a value is of type `student` (or whatever other structure)

### Structure Function Template

- Take things 'out of the box'

```scheme
; student-template : student -> ?
(define (student-template student)
	(... (student-first student) ...
			 (student-last student) ...
			 (student-gpa student) ...
			 (student-on-coop student) ...))
```

## Ball Example

We want to make a function `move-ball`that moves the ball. Every call, add the velocity to the position for the new position.

Remember: You don't need to use every attribute of `ball` (structure) for every funciton

- ex. `draw-ball` doesn't use the velocity

## Two Balls

DO NOT DO THIS:

```scheme
(define-struct two-balls [x1 y1 vx1 vy1 x2 y2 vx2 vy2]))
```

As programmers, we want to reuse code (plus this is ugly to read)

Instead do:

```scheme
(define-struct two-balls [ball1 ball2])
```

This allows you to do this:

```scheme
(make-two-balls example-ball-1 example-ball-2) ; Nested structure
```

It is uncommon to have structure names with hyphens

### Template for `two-balls`

- You can have nested templates

```scheme
; two-balls-template : Two-Balls -> ?
(define (two-balls-template tb)
	(... (ball-template (two-balls-ball1 tb)) ...
	     (ball-template (two-balls-ball2 tb)) ...))
```

- Templates let's you break down what you have to work with

You don't have to understand everything at any given time

### `draw-two-balls`

- Remember to use helper functions
    - We already have `draw-ball`

```scheme
; draw-two-balls : Two-Balls -> Image
(define (draw-two-balls tb)
	(... (draw-ball (two-balls-ball1 tb)) ...
		   (draw-ball (two-balls-ball2 tb)) ...))
```

This doesn't work right now because both balls have backgrounds (that aren't transparent)

### Recall from

[[Lecture 8 - Extended Structures]]

```scheme
(define-struct ball [x y vx vy])
```

Nested structured data:

```scheme
(define-struct two-balls [ball1 ball2])
```

### Templates

Templates are essentially the reverse of the constructor function (they unpack the box instead of create the box)

Funciton templates should also be nested for simplicity also as a reminder that you need a helper function

```scheme
(define (two-balls-template tb)
  (... (ball-template (two-balls-ball1 tb)) ...
       (ball-template (two-balls-ball2 tb)) ...))
```

---

Recall the issue with `draw-ball` that it draws two backgrounds and one completly obstructs the other. This is because the function `draw-ball` doesn't compose nicely and so we should change the function.

```scheme
;; draw-ball : Ball -> Image
;; Draws a ball on given background
(define (draw-ball-on background b)
  (place-image (circle 10 "solid" "red") (ball-x b) (ball-y b) background))
```

We now can have the first ball background image be ball2's image:

```scheme
; draw-two-balls : Ball -> Image
(define (draw-two-balls tb)
	  (draw-ball (two-balls-ball1 tb
		(draw-ball (two-balls-ball2 tb))))
```

## Let's Make a Game!

Often times small changes break examples so writing expressions instead of literal values in `check-expects` can prove to be more robust

`big-bang`can look for key presses as well (see documentation for a full list of things that `big-bang`can do)

`on-key` - called on any key press

[ ]'s ()'s and {}'s are all handled the same in Racket, but there are conventions

`on-key` sends both the state of the world and key that was pressed

```scheme
[on-key handle-key-pressed]
```

Top down programming is trying programming with 'placeholders' and filling in the gaps later. A higher level view of what's going on

Bottom up programming is building all of the helper functions first. This is useful if you understand everything about a given project

```scheme
;; flip-two-balls : Two-Balls -> Two-Balls
(define (flip-two-balls tb)
  (make-two-balls (flip-ball (two-balls-ball1 tb))
                  (flip-ball (two-balls-ball2 tb))))

;; handle-key-pressed : Two-Balls String -> Two-Balls
(define (handle-key-pressed tb key)
  (cond
    [(key=? key "f") (flip-two-balls tb)]
    [else tb]))
```

### Signatures

Yes, `big-bang` shows an animation, but it returns the same data type as the initial state of the world thus the signature would be:

```scheme
;; start-game : Two-Balls -> Two-Balls
```

## Short Circuits

Recall from

[[../CS1800 Discrete Structures|CS1800: Discrete Structures]]

```scheme
(and #true #true) ; returns true
```

With the example of `(and #false #true)` you don't even need to evaluate the right hand side because it'll always be false

This is the same with `(or #true #false`.

Foo and bar are placeholders for text in computer science. Never call a finished product foo or bar

**Why is this useful?**

```scheme
; A StringOrNumber is either:
; - string
; - Number
; is-hi? : StringOrNumber -> Boolean
(define (foo x) ; the proper name should be is-hi?
	(and (string? x) (string=? x "hi"))
```

In this case, we can throw any data type at it and it will either return `true` or `false`. If it's not a string, the first expression will be `false` so there's no need to check the 2nd expression.

# Lecture 10 - Unions and Structures

We are building up to recurrsion

Remeber that office hours are almost all of the time. Recommended to go on Monday

---

## Unions - Unbounded Number of Things

### Pie Data Definition

- Type and are they nut free?

### Pies

- Pecan Pies
- Cream Pies
- Fruit Pies
    - For every fruit pie, we need to know its type and if it has nuts

```scheme
;; Problem: Design a data definition to represent a pie. There are three kinds
;; of pies to consider: pecan pies, cream pies, and fruit pies. For every fruit
;; pie, we need to know its type, and if it is nut-free. For example, an apple
;; pie may contain nuts, whereas a lemon chiffron pie is nut-free.

;; A Pie is one of:
;; - (make-fruit-fill String Boolean)
;; - "pecan"
;; - "cream"
;;
;; Interpretation: "pecan" represents a pecan pie, "cream" represents
;; a cream pie, and (make-fruit-fill type nut-free) represents a
;; fruit pie of type _type_ and _nut-free_ indicates if it is nut free.
```

Notice the `(make-fruit-fill String Boolean)` . We don't need to make another data definition for this because functions should never have to deal with fruit-filled pies in isolation

This data definition is a union (not an enumeration) because there are infinite `(make-fruit-fill String Boolean)`'s.

## Template

- Fruit pies are a different type than the rest therefore we need to handle each condition differently.
- Remeber: templates unpack the box as much as possible

```scheme
(define (pie-template p)
  (cond
    [(fruit-fill? p) (... (fruit-fill-type p) ...
                          (fruit-fill-nut-free p) ...)]
    [(string=? p "pecan") ...]
    [(string=? p "cream") ...]))
```

Recall Short Circuiting

[[Lecture 9 - Expanding BigBang and Short Circuits]]

You can do the same thing through conditionals as well.

```scheme
(define (pie->filling/v2 p)
  (cond
    [(fruit-fill? p) (fruit-fill-type p)]
    [(string=? p "pecan") "pecan"]
    [(string=? p "cream") "cream"]))
```

If it gets the 2nd condition, we know it's not a `fruit-fill` therefore we knew that it's a string.

**We can also do this:**

```scheme
;; Design a function called pie->filling that produces a string
;; describing the filling.
;; pie->filling : Pie -> String
(define (pie->filling p)
  (cond
    [(and (string? p) (string=? p "pecan")) "pecan"]
    [(and (string? p) (string=? p "cream")) "cream"]
    [(fruit-fill? p) (fruit-fill-type p)]))
```

This example is more robust because you can reorder things and it's more readable to humans.

If you have an if that returns `#true` or `#false`, you can make it more compact by just writing the condition (if it's the inverse, add `(not` to the beginning).

Example:

```scheme
;; requires-baking? : Pie -> Boolean
(define (requires-baking? p)
  (cond
    [(fruit-fill? p)
     ;(... (fruit-fill-type p) ...
     ;                     (fruit-fill-nut-free p) ...)
     ;(if (string=? "lemon chiffron" (fruit-fill-type p))
     ;    #false
     ;    #true)
     (not (string=? "lemon chiffron" (fruit-fill-type p)))]
    [(string=? p "pecan") #true]
    [(string=? p "cream") #false]))
```

    ;; A Pie is one of:
    ;; - (make-fruit-fill String Boolean)
    ;; - "pecan"
    ;; - "cream"
    ;;
    ;; Interpretation: "pecan" represents a pecan pie, "cream" represents
    ;; a cream pie, and (make-fruit-fill type nut-free) represents a

    (define-struct fruit-fill (type nut-free))

    (define (pie-template p)

    (define ex-apple-pie (make-fruit-fill "apple" #false))
    (define ex-lf (make-fruit-fill "lemon chiffron" #true))

    ;; Design a function called pie->filling that produces a string

    (check-expect (pie->filling ex-pecan) "pecan")
    (check-expect (pie->filling ex-apple-pie) "apple")

    ;; Design a function called requires->baking? To check if a PIe requires
    ;; baking. Pecan pies, and all fruit pies, but not the lemon chiffron,

         ;    #false
         ;    #true)
         (not (string=? "lemon chiffron" (fruit-fill-type p)))]
        [(string=? p "pecan") #true]
        [(string=? p "cream") #false]))

    (check-expect (requires-baking? ex-lf) #false)
    (check-expect (requires-baking? ex-apple-pie) #true)
    ```

### Location Example

Template:

```scheme
;; A GeoCoord is one of:
;; - Location
;; - PositiveNumber
;; - NegativeNumber
;;
;; Interpretation: It represents either a location on the
;; Earth's surface, an altitude in the air (positive number),
;; or a depth in the sea (negative number).

;; Problem: Complete the data definion for GeoCoord

(define (geocoord-template gc)
  (cond
    ;[(location? gc) (... (location-latitude gc) ...
    ;                     (location-longitude gc) ...)]
    [(location? gc) (location-template gc)]
    [(>= gc 0) ...]
    ;[(and (number? gc) (>= gc 0)) ???]
    [(< gc 0) ...]))
```

This is also a **union**.

- Full GeoCoord Example Code

    ```scheme
    ;; A Location is a (make-location Number Number).
    ;;
    ;; Interpretation: A (make-location lat long) is a coordinate
    ;; on the Earth's surface.

    (define-struct location [latitude longitude])

    ;; Example Locations
    (define boston-location (make-location 42 71))
    (define area51-location (make-location 37 115))
    (define crater-lake-location (make-location 42 133))

    ;; location-temp : Location -> ?
    (define (location-temp loc)
      (... (location-latitude loc) ...
           (location-longitude loc) ...))

    ;; A GeoCoord is one of:
    ;; - Location
    ;; - PositiveNumber
    ;; - NegativeNumber
    ;;
    ;; Interpretation: It represents either a location on the
    ;; Earth's surface, an altitude in the air (positive number),
    ;; or a depth in the sea (negative number).

    ;; Problem: Complete the data definion for GeoCoord

    (define (geocoord-template gc)
      (cond
        ;[(location? gc) (... (location-latitude gc) ...
        ;                     (location-longitude gc) ...)]
        [(location? gc) (location-template gc)]
        [(>= gc 0) ...]
        ;[(and (number? gc) (>= gc 0)) ???]
        [(< gc 0) ...]))
    ```
# Lecture 11 - Working with Unions

For HW examples you need at least 3 examples. Make sure you have no Halloween colors!

Structured data and unions are more powerful than we have demonstrated so far.

**Example with Employees:**

```scheme
(define-struct fulltime [name salary])
;; A FullTime is a (make-fulltime String Number)
;; Interpretation: A (make-fulltime n s) represents
;; a full time employee named n with annual salary s.
```

When you write a template, you tell yourself that functions that use the structure should use at least one piece of information from the structure.

```scheme
;; fulltime-temp : FullTime -> ?
(define (fulltime-template ft)
  ; Translation: Do something with (fulltime-name ft) and/or
  ; (fulltime-salary ft)
  (... (fulltime-name ft) ... (fulltime-salary ft) ...))
```

Formal Definitions:

- What we've been doing; written in pseudo code

Informal Definitions:

- The English interpretation of what you want to do; expressed in comments.
- Don't do this

**Both `fulltime` and `interns` are employees.**

### Data Definition - Union

See

[[Lecture 10 - Unions and Structures]]

```scheme
;; An Employee is one of:
;; - FullTime
;; - Intern
;; Interpretation: An Employee of our prestigious company.
```

If we don't use a structure directly (for example, `FullTime` or `Intern`), we do not need a template for it.

### Template

```scheme
(define (employee-template emp)
  (cond
    [(fulltime? emp)
     ; Call a helper function with emp, that consumes
     ; a Fulltime
     (fulltime-template emp)]
    ; Call a helper function with emp, that consumes an Intern.
    [(intern? emp) (intern-template emp)]))
```

### Making a Function that Works with Unions

Make a conditional with checks for what structure it is then call different helper functions for each possibility.

Ex: Monthly Pay

```scheme
;; monthly-pay : Employee -> Number
;; Purpose: Produces the monthly pay for an employee.

(check-expect (monthly-pay employee-1) (* 15 30 4))
(check-expect (monthly-pay employee-2) (/ 75000 12))

(define (monthly-pay emp)
  (cond
    [(fulltime? emp) (fulltime->monthly-pay emp)]
    [(intern? emp) (intern->monthly-pay emp)]))
```

Unions with multiple structures is very common in the real world

### Data Definition with No Examples

```scheme
;; An NNN is a non-negative number
```

In the example of `NNN`, it is self-explainitory therefore we do not need a data definition for it

You need a template for homework in this calss. If code works but no documentation/template/data definition, you will get about a 30%

### Templates with Unions

```scheme
; Define the types of data:
; - (make-[structure] ...)
; - (make-[other_structure] ...)
```

## Species Example

```scheme
;; An NNN is a non-negative number

; A Species is one of:
; - "dog"
; - "cat"
; - "goldfish"
(define (species-template s)
  (cond
    [(string=? s "dog") ...]
    [(string=? s "cat") ..]
    [(string=? s "goldfish") ..]))

(define-struct pet [species age weight])
; A Pet is a (make-pet Species NNN NNN)
; interpretation A (make-pet s a w) represents a pet, where s is the
; species of animal, with age a in human years, and weight w in pounds.

;; TODO: Examples and template
(define ex-goldfish (make-pet "goldfish" 19 (/ 4 16)))
(define ex-goldfish/v2 (make-pet "goldfish" 19 4/16))
(define ex-cat (make-pet "cat" 18 17))
(define ex-dog (make-pet "dog" 6 50))

(define (pet-template p)
  ; It is a (make-pet ...). Remember to use (pet-species p),
  ; (pet-age p), and/or (pet-weight p).
  (... (pet-species p) ...
       (pet-age p) ...
       (pet-weight p) ...))

;;-------------------------------------------------------------------

; Design the function pet-years. It consumes a Pet and returns a
; sentence with the petâ€™s age in the animalâ€™s own years (i.e., dog years,
; cat years or goldfish years). The sentence should be of the form
; "N in animal years" where N is the age in dog years or cat years.
; E.g., for a pet dog of age 10 in human years, pet-years produces
; "70 in animal years".

;  One human year is 7 dog years.
;  One human year is 4 cat years.
;  One human year is 5 goldfish years.

;; Produces a factor to multiply a species age in human years, to get
;; species animal age.
(define (species-to-human-years s)
  (cond
    [(string=? s "dog") 7]
    [(string=? s "Cat") 4]
    [(string=? s "goldfish") 5]))

;; pet-years : Pet -> String
(define (pet-years p)
  ; It is a (make-pet ...). Remember to use (pet-species p),
  ; (pet-age p), and/or (pet-weight p).
  (string-append
   (number->string (* (species-to-human-years (pet-species p))  (pet-age p)))
   " in animal years"))
```

# Lecture 12 - Into to Self Referential Data

Saturday 10th - Exam study session (4-6pm)

The lab tomorrow (Oct. 6th) explains how to take an exam

Exam

- Similar to the homework problems

## Intro into Self Referential Data

What if we want a lab with an arbitrary amount of TA's?

We could do:

```scheme
(define-struct lab-with-1ta [Name Number])
(define-struct lab-with-2tas [Name Name Number])
(define-struct lab-with-3tas [Name Name Name Number])
```

This is BAD PRACTICE!

- It's not scalible

### How do we have an arbatrary amount of TAs?

```scheme
(define-struct lab [section])
(define-struct add-ta [name rest-lab])
;; A FundiesLab is one of:
;; - (make-lab Natural)
;; - (make-add-ta String FundiesLab)
;;
;; Interpretation: A FundiesLab is either a (make-lab n), where n is the section
;; number of the lab (and it has no TAs assigned); or a (make-add-ta name l),
;; name is the name of a TA to add to the lab l.
```

In the definition of `FundiesLab`, you use a `FundiesLab` itself

In this method, you can have arbitrary number of TA's

You can also "add" TA's to any already defined lab

### Template

How can we unpack the box here?

- Check to see if it's a `lab`
- Check to see if it's an `add-ta` (in which case we need to do more work)

```scheme
;; fundies-lab-template : FundiesLab -> ?
(define (fundies-lab-template fl)
  (cond
    [(lab? fl) (... (lab-section fl) ...)]
    [(add-ta? fl) (... (add-ta-name fl) ...
                       (fundies-lab-template (add-ta-rest-lab fl)) ...)]))
```

Notice how the function `fundies-lab-template` is called inside of itself

This is called a **RECURSIVE** function

### Example Function 1

Count the number of TA's in a given lab

```scheme
;; Problem: Design a function to count the number of TAs in a lab.
;(check-expect (count-tas lab-ex-1)  0)
;(check-expect (count-tas lab-ex-2)  1)
;(check-expect (count-tas lab-ex-3)  2)
;; count-tas : FundiesLab ->  Natural
(define (count-tas fl)
  (cond
    [(lab? fl) 0]
    [(add-ta? fl) (+ 1 (count-tas (add-ta-rest-lab fl)))]))
```

### Example Function 2

Check if "Daniel Goldstein" is a member of any given lab

```scheme
;; Design a function to check if "Daniel Goldstein" is a member of
;; a lab.
;; has-daniel? :: FundiesLab -> Boolean
(check-expect (has-daniel? lab-ex-2) #false)
(check-expect (has-daniel? lab-ex-3) #true)

(define (has-daniel?-bad-style fl)
  (cond
    [(lab? fl) #false]
    [(add-ta? fl) (if (string=? "Daniel Goldstein" (add-ta-name fl))
                      #true
                      (if (has-daniel?-bad-style (add-ta-rest-lab fl))
                          #true
                          #false))]))

(define lab-ex-4 (make-add-ta "Aislin Black"
                              (make-add-ta "Daniel Goldstein" (make-lab 30))))

(check-expect (has-daniel? lab-ex-4) #true)

(define (has-daniel? fl)
  (cond
    [(lab? fl) #false]
    [(add-ta? fl) (or (string=? "Daniel Goldstein" (add-ta-name fl))
                      (has-daniel? (add-ta-rest-lab fl)))]))
```

### Example Function 3

Create a String of a `FundiesLab` which describes itself

```scheme
;; Design a function that consumes a FundiesLab and produces a string
;; describing it.
;(check-expect (describe-lab lab-ex-3) "Lab 20: Aislin Black Daniel Goldstein")
;; describe-lab : FundiesLab -> String

(define (describe-lab fl)
  (cond
    [(lab? fl) (string-append "Lab " (number->string (lab-section fl)))]
    [(add-ta? fl) (string-append
                   (describe-lab (add-ta-rest-lab fl))
                   " "
                   (add-ta-name fl)
                   )]))
```

# Lecture 13 - Continued Refferential Data Definitions

### Bullseye Example

- Self refferential union

```scheme
(define-struct ring [color radius more])
;; A Bullseye is a
;; - "center"
;; - (make-ring String NNN Bullseye)
;;
;; Interpretation: Represents concentric rings of a bullseye target, with
;; _"center"_ representing the center (with no rings), and _(make-ring c r b)_
;; representing the target whose outermost ring has color _c_ and radius _r_,
;; and the remaining rings within are _b_.

(define ex-be-1 "center")
(define ex-be-2 (make-ring "red" 10 ex-be-1))
(define ex-be-3 (make-ring "white" 20 ex-be-2))
(define ex-be-4 (make-ring "red" 30 ex-be-3))
(define ex-be-5 (make-ring "green" 35 ex-be-2))
```

### Template

CamelCase for Data Definitions and hypenations for structures

Whenever you have a union, you use a conditional in the template

```scheme
; bullseye-template : Bullseye -> ?
(define (bullseye-template be)
  (cond
    [(string? be) ...]
    [(ring? be) (... (ring-color be) ...
                     (ring-radius be) ...
                     (bullseye-template (ring-more be)) ...)]))
```

Remeber: whenever you have a box inside another box, you should write a helper function

### Example Function 1 - Count Rings

```scheme
;; count-rings : Bullseye -> Number
;; Counts the number of rings in a Bullseye; the "center" is not
;; a ring.
(define (count-rings be)
  (cond
    [(string? be) 0]
    [(ring? be) (+ 1 (count-rings (ring-more be)))]))
```

### Example Function 2 - Produce Black and White Rings

```scheme
;; make-bw : Bullseye -> Bullseye
;; Produces a B&W version of the given Bullseye
(define (make-bw be)
  (cond
    [(string? be) "center"]
    [(ring? be) (make-ring
                 (if (string=? "white" (ring-color be))
                     "white"
                     "black")
                 (ring-radius be)
                 (make-bw (ring-more be)))]))
```

For check-expects, you should always check the base case

When writing functions, ask 3 questions:

- What should I do with the base case?
- How am I processing each recursive case?
- How do I put things together?

### Doll Example

Nesting dolls

- 2 Types of recursive data
- Make sure, if yo use `string?`, that you onlu have on string in the data definition

```scheme
(define-struct blue-shell (doll))
(define-struct red-shell (doll))
;; A RussianDoll is one of:
;; - "solid"
;; - (make-blue-shell RussianDoll)
;; - (make-red-shell RussianDoll)
;;
;; Interpretation: Represents a collection of russian nesting dolls. _"center"_
;; represents a solid doll. _(make-blue-shell d)_ represents a blue doll that
;; contains _d_ immediately within it. _(make-red-shell d)_ represents a red
;; doll that contains_d_ immediately within it.
```

```scheme
;; count-blue : RussianDoll -> Number
(define (count-blue doll)
  (cond
    [(string? doll) 0]
    [(blue-shell? doll)
     (+ 1 (count-blue (blue-shell-doll doll)))]
    ;[(red-shell? doll) 0]
    ;[(red-shell? doll)
    ;  0 (count-blue (red-shell-doll doll))]
    [(red-shell? doll)
      (count-blue (red-shell-doll doll))]))

(define ex-dolls-1 "solid")
(define ex-dolls-2 (make-red-shell ex-dolls-1))
(define ex-dolls-3 (make-blue-shell ex-dolls-2))
(define ex-dolls-4 (make-red-shell ex-dolls-2))

;; russian-doll-template : RussianDoll -> ?
(define (russian-doll-template doll)
  (cond
    [(string? doll) ...]
    [(blue-shell? doll)
     (... (russian-doll-template (blue-shell-doll doll)) ...)]
    [(red-shell? doll)
     (... (russian-doll-template (red-shell-doll doll)) ...)]))

;; Write a function to count the number of blue-painted dolls in a
;; set of russian dolls.
```

## Lists

Think of it as a structure with 2 fields

Empty List  - `'()`

ex. `(cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 '())))`

Examples:

```scheme
(empty? '()) ; true
(cons? (cons 1 '())) ; true
(first ex-list) ; first element
(rest ex-list) ; the rest of the list (2nd element)
```

# Lecture 14 - Lists and Midterm Prep

## Midterm

- Next Wednesday at 6-9pm
- Everything but lists
- No electronics besides one computer
- Open-ended questions
- Review session this Saturday
- Open note/book
- Practice exam on Hourglass
- Similar to homework
    - Remeber the design recipe

## Lists

- Empty: `'()`
- Create List: `(cons 10 '())`
- **Selectors**
    - First (ex. `(first ex-list-1)`): returns the first element of the list
    - Rest (ex. `(rest ex-list-1)`): Returns the second element of the list (aka the rest of the list)

### Data Definition and Template

```scheme
;; A LON (list of numbers) is one of:
;; - '()
;; - (cons Number LON)
;; Interpretation: a list of numbers
(define ex-lon-0 (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 '()))))
(define ex-lon-1 (cons 2 ex-lon-0))

(define (lon-template lon)
  (cond
    [(empty? lon) ...]
    [(cons? lon) (... (first lon) ...
                      (lon-template (rest lon)) ...)]))
```

If you return atomic data, you don't send it through a helper function

- `LON` has to be sent through the helper function (the template)

### Example Function 1: Sum of Numberes

```scheme
;; Write a function sum a list of numbers.
;; sum : LON -> Number
(define (sum lon)
  (cond
    [(empty? lon) 0]
    [(cons? lon) (+ (first lon)
                      (sum (rest lon)) )]))
```

### Example Function 2: Product of Numbers

```scheme
;; prod : LON -> Number
(define (prod lon)
  (cond
    [(empty? lon) 1]
    [(cons? lon) (* (first lon)
                      (prod (rest lon)))]))
```

You can't have the product of the empty list when it equals 0. Because the base case is always run, if you multiply it by 0, the entire thing turns to 0. Therefore, the product of empty list is usually 1.

If you want to have the base case 0, you need to do this:

```scheme
(define (prod/v2 lon)
  (cond
    [(empty? lon) 0]
    [(cons? lon) (* (first lon)
                    (if (empty? (rest lon))
                        1
                        (prod/v2 (rest lon))))]))
```

### String Example

Template is exactly the same as `lon`'s template.

```scheme
;; A LOS (list of strings) is one of:
;; - '()
;; - (cons String LOS)
;; Interpretation: A list of strings.
(define (los-template los)
  (cond
    [(empty? los) ...]
    [(cons? los) (... (first los) ...
                      (los-template (rest los)) ...)]))
```

- Not good to repeat code (we will learn a single template for lists later)

### PosnList Example

```scheme
;; A PosnList is one of:
;; - '()
;; - (cons (make-posn Number Number) PosnList)

(define ex-posn-list-1
  (cons (make-posn 137 137)
        (cons (make-posn 10 20)
              (cons (make-posn 30 40)
                    '()))))

(define (posn-list-template pl)
  (cond
    [(empty? pl) ...]
    [(cons? pl) (... (posn-x (first pl)) ...
                     (posn-y (first pl)) ...
                     (posn-list-template (rest pl)) ...)]))
```

When writing data definitions, make sure that the base case is first (a matter of style)

Remeber: Don't 'unpack' more than one box with the same template! Send it to another template!

- It won't be scalable

**Posn-Structure: `(make-posn x y)`**

### Example Function with POSN-LIST

```scheme
;; invert-posnlist :: PosnList -> PosnList
;; Invert all coordinates in the given PosnList
(define (invert-posnlist pl)
  (cond
    [(empty? pl) '()]
    [(cons? pl) (cons (make-posn (* -1 (posn-x (first pl)))
                                 (* -1 (posn-y (first pl))))
                      (invert-posnlist (rest pl)))]))

# Lecture 16 - Intro to Snake Game

### Exam Yesterday

- Tech issues! Didn't go well
- Thinking abpout options for the 2nd midterm
    - maybe just take home exam

Wants feedback for the class

- Have any problems?

Homework due date pushed back until Saturday

Mid-semester surveys

- They are important
- Long queue for Office Hours
    - Tweaks being implemented

## Building the Snake Game

"Don't use Reddit; it's not good for you" - Arjun

Projects will drag on for 3-4 homework assignments

Goal: Build a Big-Bang program

- on-tick = move the snake
- on-key = change direction of snake
- on-draw = draw
- stop-when = game over

### What is the Scene?

- Everything of interest
    - Position of snake's segments
    - Direction of snake

### What Goes into the World State?

- Things that change/are updated
- Everything else should just be a constant

The brainstorm from class:

```scheme
; X & Y coord of snake's head
; length of snake
; position of snake
; direction in which the snake is moving
; game clock
; food position
```

### Segments of the Snake

- Self-referential data-definition

```scheme
;; A Segments is a NEListofPosn
;;
;; Interpretation: The grid coordinates where the snake lies, the
;; position of the head is the first element of the NEList.
(define ex-segs-1 (cons (make-posn 4 4) (cons (make-posn 4 5) '())))
(define ex-segs-2 (cons (make-posn 4 3) ex-segs-1))
(define ex-segs-3 (cons (make-posn 3 3) ex-segs-2))

(define (segs-template ss)
  (cond
    [(empty? ss) ...]
    [(cons? ss) (... (first ss) ...
                     (segs-template (rest ss)) ...)]))
```

`NEListofPosn` = "non-empty list of Posns"

- The first one is the head and the last one is the tail
- Remeber: the difference between sugments have to be 1 in the x or 1 in the y needs to be continuous
    - Make sure your examples are correct

While doing a project, you should switch perspectives (high level vs. low level) frequently

### Snake Data Definition

```scheme
;; A Snake is a (make-snake Direction Segments)
;; Interpretation: A snake _(make-snape d ss)_ is a snake in
;; moving in _d_, and laying at _ss_ on the grid.
(define snake-1 (make-snake "left" ex-segs-1))
(define snake-2 (make-snake "up" ex-segs-2))
(define snake-3 (make-snake "up" ex-segs-3))
(define snake-4 (make-snake "left" ex-segs-3))

(define (snake-template s)
  (... (direction-template (snake-dir s)) ...
       (segments-template (snake-segs s)) ...))
```

### Draw-snake Function

```scheme
;; draw-segments : Segments -> Image
(define (draw-segments ss)
  (cond
    [(empty? ss) BACKGROUND]
    [(cons? ss) (place-image SEGMENT-IMAGE
                             (* 10 (posn-x (first ss)))
                             (* 10 (posn-y (first ss)))
                             (draw-segments (rest ss)))]))
;; draw-snake :: Snake -> Image
(define (draw-snake s)
  (draw-segments (snake-segs s)))

# Lecture 17 - Into to Abstraction

Midterm grades will be released at the end of the day today

**Partner Switch**

- Only switch of the semester happens this week

## Part II of the Class: Abstractions

Beginner Student Language â†’ Intermediate Student Language

- Lists can now be represented as `(list 1 2 3 4 5)`
    - Function `(list?` returns whether or not something is a `cons` or `'()`
- This is useful for nested lists

'() can also be written as (list)

## Abstraction

Design a function that prefixes every String in a list of Strings with "Hi "

```scheme
;; Design a function that consumes a ListOfStrings and produces
;; a new list that prefixes all strings with "Hi ".
;; prefix-hi : ListOfStrings -> ListOfStrings
(define (prefix-hi/v1 los)
  (cond
    [(empty? los) '()]
    [(cons? los) (cons (string-append "Hi " (first los))
                      (prefix-hi/v1 (rest los)))]))

(check-expect (prefix-hi/v1 (list)) (list))

(check-expect (prefix-hi/v1 (list "Arjun" "Amal"))
              (list "Hi Arjun" "Hi Amal"))
```

Design a funciton that prefixes every String in a list of String with "Hi "

```scheme
;; prefix-bye : ListOfStrings -> ListOfStrings
(define (prefix-bye/v1 los)

  (cond
    [(empty? los) '()]
    [(cons? los) (cons (string-append "Bye " (first los))
                      (prefix-bye/v1 (rest los)))]))

(check-expect (prefix-bye/v1 (list "Arjun" "Amal"))
              (list "Bye Arjun" "Bye Amal"))
```

Don't copy and paste code!! Programmers make 1 error for every 10 linues so you would copy and paste the errors as well

The other reason is you're left with **repetitive code**

- Bad practice

### Example 1: Prefixes

```scheme
;; prefix-with : String ListOfStrings -> ListOfStrings
(define (prefix-with to-prefix los)
    (cond
    [(empty? los) '()]
    [(cons? los) (cons (string-append to-prefix (first los))
                      (prefix-with to-prefix (rest los)))]))

;; prefix-hi/v2 : ListOfStrings -> ListOfStrings
(define (prefix-hi/v2 los)
  (prefix-with "Hi " los))

;; prefix-bye/v2 : ListOfStrings -> ListOfStrings
(define (prefix-bye/v2 los)
  (prefix-with "Bye " los))

(check-expect (prefix-bye/v2 (list "Arjun" "Amal"))
              (list "Bye Arjun" "Bye Amal"))

(check-expect (prefix-hi/v2 (list "Arjun" "Amal"))
              (list "Hi Arjun" "Hi Amal"))
```

- Reduces the repetition by taking out the similarity

### Example 2: Addition and Multiplication

```scheme
;; add-ten-all : LON -> LON
(check-expect (add-ten-all '(1 2 3))
              '(11 12 13))
(define (add-ten-all lon)
  (cond
    [(empty? lon) '()]
    [(cons? lon) (cons (+ 10 (first lon))
                      (add-ten-all (rest lon)))]))

;; mul-five-all : LON -> LON
(check-expect (mul-five-all '(1 2 3))
              '(5 10 15))
(define (mul-five-all lon)
  (cond
    [(empty? lon) '()]
    [(cons? lon) (cons (* 5 (first lon))
                      (mul-five-all (rest lon)))]))
```

There are two fundamental differences between these functions

- Operation and number

**How can we have only 1 difference?**

Create helper function that does the operation on a single number

- The only difference is the helper funciton they call

### You can have funcitons as function parameters!!!

```scheme
;; add10 : Number -> Number
(define (add10 n)
  (+ 10 n))

;; mul5 : Number -> Number
(define (mul5 n)
  (* 5 n))

;; add-ten-all/v2 : LON -> LON
(define (add-ten-all/v2 lon)
  (cond
    [(empty? lon) '()]
    [(cons? lon) (cons (add10 (first lon))
                       (add-ten-all/v2 (rest lon)))]))

;; mul-five-all/v2 : LON -> LON
(define (mul-five-all/v2 lon)
  (cond
    [(empty? lon) '()]
    [(cons? lon) (cons (mul5 (first lon))
                       (mul-five-all/v2 (rest lon)))]))

(check-expect (add-ten-all/v2 '(1 2 3))
              '(11 12 13))
(check-expect (mul-five-all/v2 '(1 2 3))
              '(5 10 15))

;; apply-to-all : (Number -> Number)  LON -> LON
;; apply-to-all : (String -> String)  LOS -> LOS
(define (apply-to-all f lon)
  (cond
    [(empty? lon) '()]
    [(cons? lon) (cons (f (first lon))
                       (apply-to-all f (rest lon)))]))
```

Notice the signature! (The parenthesis note the funciton)

`apply-to-all` is already built into ISL under the name `map`

### Signature

What is the signature of `apply-to-all`?

```scheme
;; apply-to-all : (Number -> Number)  LON -> LON
;; apply-to-all : (String -> String)  LOS -> LOS
```

More on this later!

- Lambda expression

# Lecture 18 - Expanded Abstraction

### Recap on Abstraction

- You can send functions as function inputs
- Helper functions are used to create a similar general funciton

**Apply-to-all**

- Performs a funciton on every element in a list

### Signature for `apply-to-all`

```scheme
; apply-to-all : (Number -> Number)  LON -> LON
; apply-to-all : (String -> String) LOS -> LOS
```

But this works with any datatype (not just Number or String). These types of functions are known as "general functions" or "polymorphic functions"

### General Signature

```scheme
; apply-to-all : {X Y} (X -> Y) [List-of X] -> [List-of Y]
```

NOTE: The `X` and `Y` are in curly brackets to denote that they are arbitrary variables and not previously defined.

### Example 1: `many-circles`

Almost always start with the map function

```scheme
;; many-circles : [List-of Integer] -> [List-of Image]
(define (many-circles l)
  (map do-circle l))
```

"Computers, they're out to get me. Gotta study my enemies" - Arjun

### Example 2: `give-evens`

- Cannot write this function using `apply-to-all` (`map`) because the helper function needs to return something (you can't 'skip' a number)

```scheme
;; a.k.a. filter
;; give-kind-of : {X} (X -> Boolean) [List-of X] -> [List-of X]

;; (give-kind-of f (list x1 x2 ... x_n))
;; produces
;; (list ... x_i ... x_j ...) only if (f x_i), (f x_j) is #true
(define (give-kind-of f l)
  (cond
    [(empty? l) '()]
    [(cons? l)
     (if (f (first l))
         (cons (first l) (give-kind-of f (rest l)))
         (give-kind-of f (rest l)))]))

; give-evens : [List-of Number] -> [List-of Number]
(define (give-evens l)
  (give-kind-of even? l))
```

NOTE: `give-kind-of` is the same as `filter`

- It will never call two recursive functions in the same layer.
- Two options for recursion

### Example 3: `give-capitalized`

Similar to Example 2. You can't use `apply-to-all` (`map`) to it either.

```scheme
;; capitalized? : String -> Boolean
(define (capitalized? s)
  (string=? s (string-upcase s)))

; give-capitalized : [List-of String] -> [List-of String]
(define (give-capitalized l)
  (give-kind-of capitalized? l))
```

## Abstracting Functions

- Play spot the difference with the two functions
- Make only one difference (use helper functions)

---

## Map and Filter

Map: always produce a list of the same length

Filter: input [List-of X], always returns [List-of X]
# Lecture 19 - Scope and Local

### Things they want to teach

- Theorietical foundations of computing
    - Design recipe
- Mechanics of programming
    - Time spend on a keyboard

### Abstraction

Recall: We derived the built-in functions `map` and `filter`

```scheme
;; apply-to-all : {X Y} (X -> Y) [List-of X] -> [List-of Y]
;;
;; Purpose:
;;
;; _(apply-to-all f (list x y z ...))_ produces the list
;; _(list (f x) (f y) (f z) ...)_.
(define (apply-to-all f l)
  (cond
    [(empty? l) '()]
    [(cons? l) (cons (f (first l))
                       (apply-to-all f (rest l)))]
```

### Check Syntax

- Gives a graphical representation of where variables and functions come from
- USE IT!

### Local Definitions:

Recall that `mul5` was the helper function to `mul-five-all`

This makes it seem like `mul5` is an important function outside of `mul-five-all` (which it's not)

**Local :** Can declare a helper function only within another function

- Still need a signature
- Don't use this for every helper function, only the ones that require it
- The variables (including function inputs) pass from the main function to the helper function (see this in `many-circles` example below)

```scheme
;; mul-five-all : LON -> LON
(define (mul-five-all/v2 lon)
  (local (;; mul5 : Number -> Number
          (define (mul5/v2 n)
            (* 5 n)))
    (apply-to-all mul5/v2 lon)
```

These are only necessary when you need to pass more variables into the helper function

## Examples of Abstraction

### `many-circles` example

**How can we pass a color into the helper function as well?**

Use a `local`

```scheme
;; many-circles/v2 : Color [List-of Integer] -> [List-of Image]
(define (many-circles/v2 c l)
  (local ((define (do-circle/v2 r)
            (circle r "solid" c)))
    (apply-to-all do-circle/v2 l)))
```

### `mul-all-by` example

Multiply every element in a list by a given number

```scheme
;; mul-all-by : Number LON -> LON
(define (mul-all-by n lon)
  (local ((define (multiplier m)
            (* m n)))
    (apply-to-all multiplier lon)))
```

## Abstraction with 2 Differences (Challenge problem)

Create an abstraction for `sum-all` and `mul-all` (that can be used for things that aren't just numbers)

There are two differences

- Base case
- Function called

```scheme
;; my-foldr :: { X Y } (X Y -> Y) Y [List-of X] -> Y
(define (my-foldr f base lon)
  (cond
    [(empty? lon) base]
    [(cons? lon) (f (first lon) (my-foldr f base (rest lon)))]))
```

`do-all` is already built into Racket as `foldr`

### Signature

```scheme
;; my-foldr :: {X} (X X -> X) X [List-of X] -> X
; THE MOST GENERAL!
;; my-foldr :: {X Y} (X Y -> Y) Y [List-of X] -> Y ; don't have to be the same
```

### Example: `total-len`

```scheme
;; Problem: Write a function to calculuate the total length of a list of strings

;; total-len-helper : String Number -> Number
(define (total-len-helper x y)
  (+ (string-length x) y ))

;; my-foldr :: { X Y } (X Y -> Y) Y [List-of X] -> Y
;; x = String
;; y = Number
(define (total-len los)
  (my-foldr ??? 0 los))
```

```scheme
(my-foldr cons '() (list 10 20 30 40))
; Returns: (list 10 20 30 40)
```

Callenge problem:

```scheme
(define (apply-to-all/v2 f l)
	(my-foldr ...))
```

# Lecture 20 - Built-in Abstraction Functions

"I apologize for swearing. No, not really" - Arjun

## Programming with List Abstractions

### Map

```scheme
; _(map f (list x y x ...))_ producees _(list (f x) (f y) (f z) ...)_.
```

However, it's more complicated. It really does this:

```scheme
; What map really does
(define (add10 x) (+ x 10))
(my-map add10 (cons 1 (cons 2 '())))
(cons (add10 1) (my-map add10 (cons 2 '())))
(cons 11 (my-map add10 (cons 2 '())))
(cons 11 (cons (add10 2) (my-map add10 '())))
(cons 11 (cons 12 (my-map add10 '())))
(cons 11 (cons 12 '()))

(cons (add10 1) (cons (add10 2) '()))
(list (add10 1) (add10 2))
```

It does not do this:

```scheme
(list (add10 1) (add10 2))
```

Although it is close enough for our purposes.

### Filter

```scheme
; filter : {X} (X -> Boolean) [List-of X] -> [List-of X]
```

See previous lectures for more information.

### Foldr

```scheme
; foldr : {X Y} (X Y -> Y) Y [List-of X] -> Y
```

**Purpose statement:**

With 3 elements (x, y, and z):

```scheme
; Purpose: _(folder f base (list x y z))_ produces _(f x (f y (f z base)))_
```

With unknown elements:

```scheme
; Purpose: _(folder f base (list x y ... z))_ produces _(f x (f y (f ... (f z base))))_.
```

Example

```scheme
(foldr + 0 (cons 10 (cons 20 (cons 30 '()))))
(+ 10 (+ 20 (+ 30 0)))
```

## Foldr

```scheme
; A [List-of X] is one of:
; - '()
; - (cons X [List-of X])
;
; Interpretation: A list of items, where every item is an X.

(define (my-foldr f base l)
  (cond
    [(empty? lon) base]
    [(cons? lon) (f (first l)
                    (my-foldr f base (rest l)))]))
```

Notice how `foldr` (my-foldr) is the same as the `list-template`.

- All functions that use the `list-template` can be used with `foldr` (although sometimes it makes it worse)

**Example:**

`length` - Calculates the length of a list

```scheme
; my-length : {X} [List-of X] -> Integer
```

```scheme
;; my-length : {X} [List-of X] -> Integer
;; Calculuates the length of the given list.
(define (my-length l)
    (cond
    [(empty? l) 0]
    [(cons? l) (+ 1 ; this does not matter: (first l)
                  (my-length (rest l)))]))

(define (my-length-helper list-item length-of-the-rest)
  (+ 1 length-of-the-rest))

(define (my-length/v2 l)
  (foldr my-length-helper 0 l))
```

Creating `length` (`my-length`) using `foldr`.

- Don't have to use all arguments while making a function. `foldr` gives you all items, so if you don't need it, don't use it.

**Example**

Creating `filter` (`my-filter`) using `foldr`.

- There are two recursive calls. So how can we make it look like the template?

<SLC - my-filter/v2>

- Notice that we used local to define the similarity in the `my-filter` function

While writting the 'same' function in homeworks, you can check-expect against other versions. `(check-expect (function/v1 x) (function/v2 x))`

```scheme
;; my-filter : {X} (X -> Boolean) [List-of X] -> [List-of X]
;;
;; Purpose: _(my-filter f l)_ produces all elements _x_ of _l_ on which
;; _(f x)_ is _#true_.
(define (my-filter/v2 f l)
  (cond
    [(empty? l) '()]
    [(cons? l)
     (local ([define the-first (first l)]
             [define rest-filtered (my-filter/v2 f (rest l))])
       (if (f the-first)
           (cons the-first rest-filtered)
           rest-filtered))]))

(define (my-filter/v3 f l)
  (local ((define (filter-helper the-first rest-filtered)
            (if (f the-first)
                (cons the-first rest-filtered)
                rest-filtered)))
    (my-foldr filter-helper '() l)))

(check-expect (my-filter/v2 even? (list 1 2 3 4)) (list 2 4))

(check-expect (my-filter/v3 even? (list 1 2 3 4))
              (my-filter/v2 even? (list 1 2 3 4)))
```

To make the extra argument available to the helper function, you have to make the helper function local.

### Build-list

```scheme
; Purpose:
; _(build-list f n)_ produces
; _(list (f 0) (f 1) ... (f (- n 1)))_
```

`identity` - Produces it's argument

Build-list produces a list that sends whose elements are the function prodived with the argument 0 through n.

### Countdown

```scheme
;; countdown : Integer -> String

[define (add-space s)
            (string-append s " ")]
;; countdown : Integer -> [List-of Integer]
(define (countdown n)
  (local ([define (build-list-helper i)
            (- n i)]
          )
    (foldr string-append
           "blastoff!"
           (map add-space
                (map number->string
                     (build-list n build-list-helper))))))

;(check-expect (countdown 5) "5 4 3 2 1 blastoff!")

(countdown 5)
```

- If a function doesn't have to be local, it's easier to read if it's global

# Lecture 21 - Introduction to Lambda

"I've only fallen asleep while talking once" - Arjun

Things you can do with functions

1. Calling the function directly
2. Using it as an argument for another function
3. Put functions inside other functions using `local`
4. **Write functions that return functions**
    - Introduced this lecture

### Function as argument

```scheme
;; add-ten : Number -> Number
(define (add-ten n)
	(+ n 10))
```

```scheme
(map add-ten (list 10 20 30))
```

Passing `add-ten` as a parameter

### Local Function

```scheme
;; add-all-by : Number [List-of Number] -> [List-of Number]
(define (add-all-by n l)
  (local (; helper : Number -> Number
          [define (helper m)
            (+ n m)])
    (map helper l)))
```

- Uses local function

---

## Functions that Produce other Functions

```scheme
;; silly : Any -> (Number -> Number)
(define (silly n)
  add-ten)

;; example-number : Number
(define example-number 3487657845)

(define f (silly "dfkjgidsfug"))
;; why : VOID ->  Function
;; why : (Number -> Number)
;; why : Number -> Number
(define why add-ten)
```

We can also functionally re-name functions

```scheme
;; why : Number -> Number
(define why add-ten)
```

"Now that I've told you how to do that, don't do that" - Arjun

### Example `make-adder`

```scheme
;; make-adder : Number -> (Number -> Number)
(define (make-adder m)
	(local [; add : Number -> Number
					(define (add n)
						(+ n m))]
		add))
```

```scheme
;; add-hundred : Number -> Number
;; add-hundred is add with (= m 100)
(define add-hundred (make-adder 100))

;; add-five is add with (= m 5)
(define add-five (make-adder 5))
```

```scheme
(make-adder 7) ; Produces a function: (lambda (al) ...)
; We can also do:
((make-adder 10) 5) ; Produces: 15
```

### Example `guessing-game`

```scheme
; guessing-game : Number -> (Number -> String)
(define (guessing-game n)
  (local (; guess : Number -> String
          [define (guess m)
            (cond
              [(= m n) "Correct!"]
              [(< m n) "Go higher!"]
              [(> m n) "Go lower!"])])
    guess))
```

```scheme
(define game (guessing-game (random 1000000)))
```

The actual number is hidden from us; the only way to figure it out is to go through the entire guessing game

Recall:

```scheme
;; add-ten : Number -> Number
(define (add-ten n)
	(+ n 10))
```

## Lambda

We don't *have* to give names to functions:

```scheme
(lambda (n) (+ n 10)) ; A nameless function
```

Example:

```scheme
(map (lambda (n) (+ n 10)) (list 10 20 30 40 50 60))
; Returns: (list 20 30 40 50 60 70)
```

- For internal help functions, this is very useful

Example:

```scheme
(filter (lambda (s) (string=? s "hi")) (list "hi" "bye" "hi"))
; Returns: (list "hi" "hi")
```

- No need for check-expects, purpose statement, and signature for the lambda function

"shit" - Arjun

`make-adder` using lambda:

```scheme
;; make-adder : Number -> (Number -> Number)
(define (make-adder m)
	(lambda (n) (+ m n)))
```

# Lecture 22 - Local and Lambda

## Non-Empty List

It's often helpful to require for lists to be non-empty

Examples for when the empty list is meaningless:

- Minimum or Maximum of a list

### **Data Definition:**

```scheme
;; An [NE-List X] is one of:
;; - (cons X '())
;; - (cons X [NE-List X])
;; Interpretation: A non-empty list of X.
```

### **Template:**

```scheme
(define (ne-list-template nel)
	(cond
    [(empty? (rest nel)) (first nel)]
    [(not (empty? (rest nel))) (... (first nel) ...
                                    (ne-list-template (rest nel))...)]))
```

### Example: `largest`

```scheme
;; largest : [NE-List Number] -> Number
(check-expect (largest (list 5 0 0 0 0 4)) 5)
(check-expect (largest (list 4 0 0 0 0 5)) 5)
(check-expect (largest (list 4 0 7 0 0 5)) 7)

(define (largest nel)
  (cond
    [(empty? (rest nel)) (first nel)]
    [(not (empty? (rest nel)))
     (if (> (first nel) (largest (rest nel)))
         (first nel)
         (largest (rest nel)))]))

;; Challenge: rewrite the function above using folder and max
```

How long does this function take to run?

### Time Function

`time` - Returns the amount of time it takes for Racket to compute code

**Example:**

```scheme
(time (largest (list 1 2 50000000 1 2 3))) ; return essentially 0 (it's so quick)
```

For the scope of this course, every number takes the same amount of time to compare

**For every element, the time doubles for the `largest` function. So the time would be too much for lists of reasonable length**.

We call `largest` twice (one for the if statement and one that's returned from the function). To not call it twice, use a local definition.

```scheme
(define (largest/v2 nel)
  (cond
    [(empty? (rest nel)) (first nel)]
    [(not (empty? (rest nel)))
     (local ([define largest-in-rest (largest/v2 (rest nel))])
       (if (> (first nel) largest-in-rest)
         (first nel)
         largest-in-rest))]))
```

we usually don't monitor the time it takes to compute something in terms of time (because every computer is different). We, instead, usually figure out how many comparisons it takes.

### Usage of Local:

- Make functions easier to read
- Make programs run faster

## Lambda

Short-hand for `lambda` is just `Î»`.

- This can be produced with CTRL+\ (CMD on macOS).

**Recall:**

```scheme
(map (Î» (x) (+ x 10)) (list 1 2 3 4))
; Produces (list 11 12 13 14)

(map (Î» (name) (string-append "Hi " name)) (list "Arjun" "Amal"))
; Produces (list "Hi Arjun" "Hi Amal")
; NOTE: Because it's a trival example, we can replace _name_ with just _x_.
```

**Example:**

```scheme
;; Problem: design a function that consumes a list of strings and produces
;; those strings of length two in the list

;; only-two-strings : [List-of String] -> [List-of String]
(define (only-two-strings los)
  (filter (Î» (s) (= (string-length s) 2)) los))
```

**Example:**

```scheme
;; Problem: Design a funciton that consumes a list of strings and determines if
;; they are all strings of length two.

;; all-two-strings? : [List-of String] -> Boolean
(define (all-two-strings? los)
  (andmap (Î» (s) (= (string-length s) 2)) los))
```

**Example:**

```scheme
;; Design a function that consumes a list of numbers and only produces those
;; numbers that are within a given range.

; nums-in-range : Number Number [List-of Number] -> [List-of Number]
; Purpose: _(nums-in-range lo hi lon)_ produces those numbers in _lon_ that are
; greater than or equal to _lo_ and less than or equal to _hi_.
; [lo, hi].
(define (nums-in-range lo hi lon)
  (filter (Î» (n) (and (<= lo n) (<= n hi))) lon))
```

NOTE: You cannot define a helper (non-local) function for this. The lambda calls `lo` and `hi` which wouldn't be available outside the `nums-in-range` function.

You can also make the 'helper' local instead of lambda (exactly the same as if it were lambda).

# Lecture 23 - Continuation on Lambda

No lab quiz tomorrow!

### Continuation on Lambda

```scheme
(check-expect (countdown 5) "5 4 3 2 1 Blastoff!")

;; countdown : Number -> String
(define (countdown n)
  (foldr
   string-append
   "Blastoff!"
   (build-list n (lambda (i) (string-append (number->string (- n i)) " ")))))
```

`build-list` : Takes a number and a function to create a list with the elements from 0 to n with the function applied to them:

```scheme
(build-list 5 (lambda (n) n))
; Produces (list 0 1 2 3 4 5)
```

**What should you put in a lambda?**

- One line functions should be
- 4-5 lines should be the limit of the lambda

### **How Functions Work:**

```scheme
(lambda (x) (/ x 0))
; Does not throw an error (you need to call it to get the error)
```

- Does not run body until function is called
- The body of the function suspends computation

"Lambdas fuck with your mental model of how things work" - Arjun

```scheme
(define (func-a x y)
	(+ x (* 10 y)))

(func-a 2 300)
; ===>
(+ 2 (* 10 300))
; ===>
(+ 2 3000)
; ===>
3002
```

"I would hit the step button but everytime I do that, I feel this rage inside me" - Arjun

```scheme
(define (my-map f l)
  (cond
    [(empty? l) '()]
    [(cons? l) (cons (f (first l)) (my-map f (rest l)))]))

(define (add10 n) (+ n 10))
;(my-map add10 (list 1 2 3))
; ===>
;(cons (add10 (first (list 1 2 3))) (my-map add10 (rest (list 1 2 3))))
; ===>
;(cons (add10 1) (my-map add10 (list 2 3)))
; === ..... ===>
;(cons (add10 1) (cons (add10 2) (cons (add10 3) (my-map add10 '()))))
```

- When you use `map`, abstractly it turns into the list template (behind the scenes)

```scheme
;; make-add-all : Number -> ([List-of Number] -> [List-of Number])
(define (make-add-all n)
	(lambda (l)
		(map (lambda (i) (+ i n)) l)))

(define add10-all/v2 (make-add-all 10)))
```

### Sets

The set of even numbers between even numers between 1 and 10

{2, 4, 6, 8, 10}

{4, 2, 8, 10, 6} (these 2 sets are the same)

Union: {1, 3, 5} U {2, 4, 6} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Intersection: {1, 3, 5} $\cap$ {3, 5, 7} = {3, 5}

**How can we build sets in Racket?**

- We only know how to make lists
    - However, in lists, order does matter

```scheme
(define ex-set-1 (list 1 3 5))
(define ex-set-2 (list 5 3 1))
; Invalid example: (define ex-set-3 (list 1 1 3 3 5 5))
```

These are all the same set, but they are different lists

```scheme
(define ex-set-4 (list "Arjun" "Amal" "Ben"))
```

```scheme
;; A [Set X] is a [List-of X]
;; order is irrelevant; no duplicates allowed
;; union : {X} [Set X] [Set X] -> [Set X]
(define (union set1 set2)
  (foldr add set2 set1))

(check-expect (union ex-set-1 ex-set-3) (list 1 3 5 2 4 6))

;(check-expect (union
;; intersect : {X} [Set X] [Set X] -> [Set X]

;; add : {X} X [Set X] -> [Set X]
(define (add elem set)
  (if (contains? elem set)
      set
      (cons elem set)))

(check-expect (add 10 ex-set-1) (list 10 1 3 5))
(check-expect (add 3 ex-set-1) ex-set-1)

;; contains? : {X} X [Set X] -> Boolean
(define (contains? elem set)
  (ormap (lambda (elem-in-set) (equal? elem-in-set elem)) set))

(check-expect (contains? 5 ex-set-1) #true)
(check-expect (contains? 5 ex-set-2) #true)
(check-expect (contains? 50 ex-set-1) #false)

```

Using `equals?` is bad practice

- If we union { {1, 3, 5}, {2, 4, 6} } and { {5, 3, 1} }, it repeats the element {1, 3, 5}
- This is because `equals?` says that {1, 3, 5} and {5, 3, 1} are not the same set (because we are representing the sets as lists where order does matter)

# Lecture 24 - More Practice with Lambda and Locals

## Sets

Recap on Lecture 23 - building sets with lists

- Limitations
    - Can't represent all possible sets (example all even numbers)
- We can, however, represent all finite sets

Recall:

```scheme
;; A [Set X] is a [List-of X]
;; order is irrelevant; no duplicates allowed
;; union : {X} [Set X] [Set X] -> [Set X]
(define (union set1 set2)
  (foldr add set2 set1))

(check-expect (union ex-set-1 ex-set-3) (list 1 3 5 2 4 6))

;(check-expect (union
;; intersect : {X} [Set X] [Set X] -> [Set X]

;; add : {X} X [Set X] -> [Set X]
(define (add elem set)
  (if (contains? elem set)
      set
      (cons elem set)))

(check-expect (add 10 ex-set-1) (list 10 1 3 5))
(check-expect (add 3 ex-set-1) ex-set-1)

;; contains? : {X} X [Set X] -> Boolean
(define (contains? elem set)
  (ormap (lambda (elem-in-set) (equal? elem-in-set elem)) set))

(check-expect (contains? 5 ex-set-1) #true)
(check-expect (contains? 5 ex-set-2) #true)
(check-expect (contains? 50 ex-set-1) #false)

```

### Cartesian Product

Example:

setA = { 1, 3, 5 }

setB = { 20, 40, 60 }

setA * setB = { (1, 20), (1, 40), (1, 60), (3, 20) ... }

"This makes me cringe just a little bit" - Arjun

**Function:**

```scheme
;; prod :: [Set X] [Set X] -> [Set (make-pair X Y)]
(define (prod set-a set-b)
  (foldr
   append
   '()
   (map
    (lambda (a) (map (lambda (b) (make-pair a b)) set-b))
    set-a)))

(define ex-set-prod-1 (list 1 3 5 9 10 4))
(define ex-set-prod-2 (list 20 40 60))
(check-expect (length (prod ex-set-prod-1 ex-set-prod-2))
              (* (length ex-set-prod-1) (length ex-set-prod-2)))
```

- Nested `map`functions (for each in the first list, handle each in the second list)

### Characteristic Function

Let's not use lists to represent sets. Instead, let's use functions

- Can represent infinite sets this way
- Don't actually use in practice
    - It's a pain

```scheme
;; Alternate definition:
;; A [Set-of X] = X -> Boolean
;; Interpretation: A set of elements X, represented by their characteristic
;; function.
```

Example:

```scheme
(define (ex-fset-1 x)
	(or (= x 0)
		 (= x 10)
		 (= x 7)))
; This is the same as {0, 7, 10}
```

```scheme
(define (ex-fset-2 x)
	(or (even? x)
		  (= x 5)))
; This is the set of all even numbers and 5
```

**Union as a Set:**

```scheme
(define (ex-fset-3 x)
	(or (ex-fset-1 x)
		  (ex-fset-2 x)))
; The union of fset-1 and fset-2
```

**Intersect as a Set:**

```scheme
(define (ex-fset-3 x)
	(and (ex-fset-1 x)
		  (ex-fset-2 x)))
; The union of fset-1 and fset-2
```

**Contains and Add:**

```scheme
;; fcontains : X [Set X] -> Boolean
(define (fcontains? elt set)
  (set elt))

;; fadd : {X} X [Set X] -> [Set X]
(define (fadd elem1 set)
  (lambda (elem2)
    (or (equal? elem2 elem1)
        (fcontains? elem2 set))))
```

- The reason that we use `fcontains?` and not just the set funciton is because the user should not have to think of the set as a function

"There's hopefully a limit to stupid" - Arjun

### Union

```scheme
;; union : {X} [Set X] [Set X] -> [Set X]
(define (funion set1 set2)
  (lambda (query-elem)
    (or (fcontains? query-elem set1)
        (fcontains? query-elem set2))))

(define fset-empty (lambda (query-elem) #false))
```

### Complement

```scheme
(define (fcomplement set)
  (lambda (query-elem)
    (not (fcontains query-elem set))))
```

# Lecture 25 - New Kinds of Self Referential Data

Unions of structs that are self-referential are more powerful than we initially thought.

## **River Example**

If we add up the rate of water flow of all the river branches, we get the amount of water flowing in the outlet of the river.

River ends, 10 + 3 + 5 + 11 + 15 = 44

### **Data Defintion:**

```scheme
;; A River is one of
;; - (make-stream Number)
;; - (make-merge River River)
(define-struct merge [left right])
(define-struct stream [flow])

(define ex-stream-1 (make-stream 10))
(define ex-stream-2 (make-stream 3))
(define ex-stream-3 (make-stream 5))
(define ex-river-1 (make-merge ex-stream-1 (make-merge ex-stream-2 ex-stream-3)))

(define ex-river-2 (make-merge (make-merge (make-stream 30) (make-stream 20))
                                (make-stream 40)))

(define ex-river-1-full (make-merge ex-river-1
                                    (make-merge (make-stream 11)
                                                (make-stream 15))))
```

### Template:

```scheme
;; river-template : River -> ?
(define (river-template r)
  (cond
    [(stream? r) (... (stream-flow r) ...)]
    [(merge? r) (... (river-template (merge-left r)) ...
                     (river-template (merge-right r)) ...)]))
```

- Notice the two recursive calls

### Function - `flow-to-ocean`

```scheme
;; flow-to-ocean : River -> Number
(check-expect (flow-to-ocean ex-river-1-full) 44)
(check-expect (flow-to-ocean ex-stream-1) 10)

(define (flow-to-ocean r)
  (cond
    [(stream? r) (stream-flow r)]
    [(merge? r) (+ (flow-to-ocean (merge-left r))
                   (flow-to-ocean (merge-right r)))]))
```

"There is a limit to the number of things one can keep on his ears at a time" - Arjun

### Function - `count-streams`

```scheme
;; count-streams : River -> Number
;; Purpose: count the total number of streams that feed this big river.
(check-expect (count-streams ex-stream-1) 1)
(check-expect (count-streams ex-river-1-full) 5)

(define (count-streams r)
  (cond
    [(stream? r) 1]
    [(merge? r) (+ (count-streams (merge-left r))
                     (count-streams (merge-right r)))]))
```

- only change the base case between `count-streams` and `flow-to-ocean`

"Let's make this a lamer tree" - Arjun

### Function - `widest-stream`

```scheme
;; widest-stream: River -> Number
;; Purpose: Produces the flow of water through the widest stream that feeds
;; this river.
(check-expect (widest-stream ex-river-1-full) 15)
(define (widest-stream r)
  (cond
    [(stream? r) (stream-flow r)]
    [(merge? r) (max (widest-stream (merge-left r))
                     (widest-stream (merge-right r)))]))
```

## Tree Example

### Data Defintion

```scheme
;; A FruitTree is one of:
;; - (make-fruit Number Boolean)
;; - (make-leaf)
;; - (make-branch FruitTree FruitTree)
(define-struct fruit [weight ripe?])
(define-struct leaf [])
(define-struct branch [left right])

(define ex-tree-1
  (make-branch
   (make-branch
    (make-branch (make-leaf)
                 (make-leaf))
    (make-branch (make-fruit 100 #true)
                 (make-fruit 10 #false)))
   (make-branch (make-leaf)
                (make-fruit 50 #true))))
```

- Two base cases
- Note: the reason that `leaf` is a structure itself is for two reasons
    - So everything is the same type
    - Future proof â€” we can add to it later

### Template

```scheme
;; fruit-tree-template : FruitTree -> ?
(define (fruit-tree-template ft)
  (cond
    [(fruit? ft) (... (fruit-weight ft) ... (fruit-ripe? ft) ...)]
    [(leaf? ft) ...]
    [(branch? ft) (... (fruit-tree-template (branch-left ft)) ...
                       (fruit-tree-template (branch-right ft)) ...)]))
```
# Lecture 26 - Binary Trees

Exam on Nov. 23rd.

- Harder than the first exam
- It should take 1.5 hours, given 3 hours
- Material: from Day 1 to Right now

**Error:**

- `(error [STRING])` :  Produces Error

### **Association List**

```scheme
(define ex-alist-empty '())
;; [AList String]
;; An association list from NUIDs to names.
(define ex-alist-nuids
  (list (make-pair 748 "Arjun Guha")
        (make-pair 881 "Amal Ahmed")
        (make-pair 900 "Benjamin Lerner")))
```

**Lookup Function**

```scheme
;; alookup : Number [AList X] -> X
;; Produces the value associated with _search-key_ in _alist_.
;; *Assumes* that the the key is in _alist_.
(define (alookup search-key alist)
  (cond
    [(empty? alist) (error "key not found")]
    [(cons? alist)
     (if (= search-key (pair-key (first alist)))
         (pair-value (first alist))
         (alookup search-key (rest alist)))]))

(check-error (alookup 0 ex-alist-empty))
(check-expect (alookup 881 ex-alist-nuids) "Amal Ahmed")
(check-expect (alookup 748 ex-alist-nuids) "Arjun Guha
```

But what if the association list is very long?

- It might take very long

## Binary Search

- Abstract data type

Structure things as trees rather than a list.

All of the left nodes have a smaller value and the right nodes have a greater value (kind of sorted)

- This allows us to limit which children we look at to save time

"Oh, wow. There's like a phone with a curly thing." - Arjun

### Example - Leaf and Nodes

```scheme
(define-struct leaf [])
(define-struct node [left key value right])
;; A [BST X] is one of:
;; - (make-leaf)
;; - (make-node [BST X] Number X [BST X])
;; Constraint: In _(make-node left key value right)_ all the keys in _left_ are
;; less than _key_ and all the keys in _right_ are greater than _key_.
```

Every node has a left child and a right child

```scheme
(define LEAF (make-leaf))
(define ex-bst-0 (make-leaf))
(define ex-bst-1 (make-node LEAF 4 "Daniel" LEAF))
(define ex-bst-2 (make-node LEAF 3 "Amal" ex-bst-1))

(define ex-bst-3
  (make-node (make-node
              (make-leaf)
              7 "Aislin"
              (make-leaf))
             10 "Ben"
             (make-node
              (make-node (make-leaf)
                         15 "Ferd"
                         (make-leaf))
              17 "John"
              (make-leaf))))
(define ex-bst-4
  (make-node ex-bst-2
             5 "Arjun"
             ex-bst-3))
```

How do we know that 5 is on the top?

- The example was arbitrary
- For this class, don't worry about it. Just make sure that it's not left or right leaning.

### Template

```scheme
(define (bst-template abst)
    (cond
      [(leaf? abst) ...]
      [(node? abst) (...
                     (bst-template (node-left abst) ...)
                     (node-key abst) ...
                     (node-value abst) ...
                     (bst-template (node-right abst) ...))]))
```

- Note: we will learn a better way to do templates later

### Function - `lookup`

```scheme
;; lookup : {X} Number [BST X] -> X
(define (lookup query-key abst)
  (cond
    [(leaf? abst) (error "nobody")]
    [(node? abst)
     #;(if (= query-key (node-key abst))
         (node-value abst)
         (if (< query-key (node-key abst))
             (lookup query-key (node-left abst))
             (lookup query-key (node-right abst))))
     (cond
       [(= query-key (node-key abst)) (node-value abst)]
       [(< query-key (node-key abst)) (lookup query-key (node-left abst))]
       ;; ; (> query-key (node-key abst))
       ;; [else (lookup query-key (node-right abst))]
       [(> query-key (node-key abst)) (lookup query-key (node-right abst))])]))

(check-expect (lookup 7 ex-bst-4) "Aislin")
(check-error (lookup 8 ex-bst-4))
```

# Lecture 27 - More on Binary Search Trees

Exam Monday after next.

Recall Binary Search Trees:

- Leafs
- Nodes

All keys on the right of the nodes have a value higher and all of the keys on the left have a lower value.

You may write signatures for all definitions (not just functions)

```scheme
(define-struct leaf [])
(define-struct node [left key value right])
;; A [BST X] is one of:
;; - (make-leaf)
;; - (make-node [BST X] Number X [BST X])
;; Constraint: In _(make-node left key value right)_ all the keys in _left_ are
;; less than _key_ and all the keys in _right_ are greater than _key_.

(define (bst-template abst)
    (cond
      [(leaf? abst) ...]
      [(node? abst) (...
                     (bst-template (node-left abst) ...)
                     (node-key abst) ...
                     (node-value abst) ...
                     (bst-template (node-right abst) ...))]))
```

### Lookup Function

```scheme
;; lookup : {X} Number [BST X] -> X
(define (lookup query-key abst)
  (cond
    [(leaf? abst) (error "key not found")]
    [(node? abst)
     (cond
       [(= query-key (node-key abst)) (node-value abst)]
       [(< query-key (node-key abst)) (lookup query-key (node-left abst))]
       [else ; (> query-key (node-key abst))
          (lookup query-key (node-right abst))])]))
```

### Lookup Unordered

```scheme
;; lookup-unordered : {X} Number [BST X] -> X
;; Looks up the key, but does not require the ordering constraint to hold.
(define (lookup-unordered query-key abst)
  (cond
    [(leaf? abst) (error "key not found")]
    [(node? abst)
     (cond
       [(= query-key (node-key abst)) (node-value abst)]
       [else
        (if (bst-contains? query-key (node-left abst))
         (lookup-unordered query-key (node-left abst))
         (lookup-unordered query-key (node-right abst)))])]))
```

Note: This is the homework problem 11 in homework 9

- But this isn't that good because it searches the tree n times (where n is the height of the tree)

### Function - `insert`

```scheme
;; insert : {X} Number X [BST X] -> [BST X]
(define (insert query-key new-value abst)
  (cond
    [(leaf? abst) (make-node LEAF query-key new-value LEAF)]
    [(node? abst)
     (cond
       [(= query-key (node-key abst)) (make-node (node-left abst)
                                                 query-key new-value
                                                 (node-right abst))]
       [(< query-key (node-key abst))
        (make-node (insert query-key new-value (node-left abst))
                   (node-key abst) (node-value abst)
                   (node-right abst))]
       [else ; (> query-key (node-key abst))
        (make-node (node-left abst)
                   (node-key abst) (node-value abst)
                   (insert query-key new-value (node-right abst)))])]))
```

- Insert and lookup are the two functions that are actually used by the user
- We are assuming that keys are unique
    - If it has the same key, we are replacing the node

"I don't feel like scrolling. Scrolling is annoying." - Arjun

"This is evidently my wife's mask. I'm having trouble with it here." - Arjun

### Function - `list->bst`

"This smells like a foldr." - Arjun

```scheme
(define-struct pair (key val))
;; list->bst : {X} [List-of (make-pair Number X)] -> [BST X]
(define (list->bst key-val-list)
  ; (foldr + 0 lon)
  (foldr
   (lambda (new-pair partial-bst)
     (insert (pair-key new-pair) (pair-val new-pair) partial-bst))
   LEAF
   key-val-list))
```

- Non-uniform fold
- Note: when you need two values, you can package them into a struct and 'unbox' them later on

### Function - `bst-add10` and `bst-add100`

- These look similar to map

### Function - `bst-map`

```scheme
;; bst-add10 : [BST Number] -> [BST Number]
;; Adds 10 to all numbers in the BST.

;; bst-add100 : [BST Number] -> [BST Number]
;; Adds 100 to all numbers in the BST.

(define (bst-map f abst)
    (cond
      [(leaf? abst) (make-leaf)]
      [(node? abst) (make-node
                     (bst-map f  (node-left abst))

# Lecture 28 - Symbols and Symbolic Expressions

Exam on Monday

- Do quiz on Canvas to see what to do about Lecture that day

Exam

- Everything (including today's lecture)
- Signature detection
- List abstraction
    - Foldr
- Trees
- Mutual Recursion
- Most likely on Hourglass Server
    - Know by Thursday if it's on handin or Hourglass

First Exam

- Write a Data Definition â†’ Design a function

## Trees

- Multiple self-references
- Binary Search Trees
    - Multiple self-references by comparisons

### Compiler/Interpretor

- A program that runs another program
    - Ex. DrRacket is an compiler/interpretor
- What would the data definition for DrRacket be?
    - The programs that we feed into DrRacket (the code) is the data itself

## Atomic Data

```scheme
; An Atom is one of:
; - String
; - Number
; - Boolean
; - Symbol

(define (atom-template a)
	(cond
		[(string? a) ...]
		[(number? a) ...]
		[(boolean? a) ...]
		[(symbol? a) ...]))

; atom? : Any -> Boolean
(define (atom? a)
	(or
		(string? a)
		(number? a)
		(boolean? a)
		(symbol? a)))
```

### Symbols

- Essentially a string that can't have spaces
    - However, they have meaning to a computer
- Denoted by a single `'` at the beginning
    - Shorthand for `(quote ...`

```scheme
(symbol? 'foo) ; Returns #true
(symbol=? 'foo 'foo) ; Returns #true
```

- Comparing two symbols is nearly instant (compared to strings were its dependent on its length)
- You can't do normal string operations on symbols. You can only compare two symbols against each other

```scheme
'45 ; Returns the number 45
'"hello" ; Returns the string "hello"
'#true ; Returns the Boolean #true
'"Hello"5 ; Returns the String "Hello" and then the number 5
'(1 2 "hi" #true) ; Returns the list (list 1 2 "hi" #true).
; You can also nest lists by this (but don't nest the quote)
```

```scheme
'(1 2 3 4 #true "hello" "again" x y z)
; Returns (list 1 2 3 4 #true "hello" "again" 'x 'y 'z)
```

### Program Representation

```scheme
'(+ 1 2 3) ; Looks similar to a program that ISL can run.
; This list represents a program
```

```scheme
'(define (f x) (+ 2 3 x))
; Returns (list 'define (list 'f 'x) (list '+ 2 3 'x))
; Represents the program : (define (f x) (+ 2 3 x))
```

### Data Definition

```scheme
; A *symbolic expression* (SExpr) is one of:
; - Atom
; - LOS
(define (sexpr-template sexp)
	(cond
		[(atom? sexp) (atom-template (sexp)]
		[(list? sexp) (los-template sexp)]))

; A *list of SExprs* (LOS) is a [List-of SExpr]
(define (los-template los)
	(cond
		[(empty? los) ...]
		[(cons? los) (... (sexpr-template (first los)) ...
											(los-template (rest los)) ...)]))

;; Alternate Defintion:

; A *symbolic expression* (SExpr) is one of:
; - Atom
; - [List-of SExpr]
```

- These three data definitions (including Atom) is a complete representation of programs
- NOTE: SExpr and LOS are mutually self referential
- `SExpr` are just trees

### Examples

```scheme
(define ex-sexpr-1 'x)
(define ex-sexpr-2 '(+ 1 2 3))
(define ex-sexpr-2/v2 (list '+ 1 2 3))
(define ex-sexpr-3 '(define (F x) (+ x 10)))
```

### Example Problems

**All-Atoms**

```scheme
;; Problem: Write a function to produce a list of all the atoms in an
;; S-expression.

(check-expect (all-atoms ex-sexpr-3) (list 'define 'F 'x '+ 'x 10))

;; all-atoms : SExpr -> [List-of Atom]
(define (all-atoms sexp)
  (cond
    [(atom? sexp) (list sexp)]
    [(list? sexp) (los-all-atoms sexp)]))

;; los-all-atoms : LOS -> [List-of Atom]
(define (los-all-atoms los)
  (cond
    [(empty? los) '()]
    [(cons? los) (append (all-atoms (first los))
                         (los-all-atoms (rest los)))]))

;; Problem (definitely do this): use list abstractions to solve the problem above

;; Problem: Write a function that concatenates all strings in an S-experssion
;; into a single string.

(define (atom-join-strings a)
  (cond
    [(string? a) a]
    [(number? a) ...]
    [(boolean? a) ...]
    [(symbol? a) ...]))

(define (join-strings sexp)
  (cond
    [(atom? sexp) (atom-join-strings sexp)]
    [(list? sexp) (los-join-strings sexp)]))

(define (los-join-strings los)
  (cond
    [(empty? los) ...]
    [(cons? los) (... (join-strings (first los)) ...
                      (los-join-strings (rest los)) ...)]))

# Lecture 29 - More on Symbolic Expression and Templates

2 more homework assignments (after this one)

## Symbolic Expression (SExpr)

- Atomic Data
    - String
    - Number
    - Boolean
    - Symbol

```scheme
;; A *list of SExprs* (LOS) is a [List-of SExpr]

(define (atom-template a)
  (cond
    [(string? a) ...]
    [(number? a) ...]
    [(boolean? a) ...]
    [(symbol? a) ...]))

(define (sexpr-template sexp)
  (cond
    [(atom? sexp) (atom-template sexp)]
    [(list? sexp) (los-template sexp)]))

(define (los-template los)
  (cond
    [(empty? los) ...]
    [(cons? los) (... (sexpr-template (first los)) ...
                      (los-template (rest los)) ...)]))

;; Examples of SExprs
(define ex-sexpr-1 'x)
(define ex-sexpr-2 (list '+ 1 2 3))
(define ex-sexpr-3 (list 'define (list 'F 'x) (list '+ 'x 10)))
(define ex-sexpr-4 (list (list 'x 20) (list 'y 30) (list 'z 40)))
```

### Example - Replace Instances of S-Expr and replace it

```scheme
(check-expect (replace-symbol '(x y z 10 20) 'x 500) '(500 y z 10 20))
(check-expect (replace-symbol '(x x) 'x #true) '(#true #true))
(check-expect (replace-symbol '(y z) 'x 50) '(y z))

;; replace-symbol : SExpr Symbol SExpr -> SExpr
(define (replace-symbol sexp symbol new-sexpr)
  (cond
    [(atom? sexp) (replace-symbol-atom sexp symbol new-sexpr)]
    [(list? sexp) (replace-symbol-los sexp symbol new-sexpr)]))

;; replace-symbol-los : LOS Symbol SExpr -> LOS
(define (replace-symbol-los los  symbol new-sexpr)
  (cond
    [(empty? los) '()]
    [(cons? los) (cons (replace-symbol (first los)  symbol new-sexpr)
                      (replace-symbol-los (rest los)  symbol new-sexpr))]))

;; replace-symbol-atom : Atom Symbol SExpr -> SExpr
(define (replace-symbol-atom a symbol new-sexpr)
  (if (and (symbol? a) (symbol=? a symbol))
      new-sexpr
      a))

(define ex-sexpr-5 '(+ x 10 (* y 20)))
```

- Challenge Round:
    - Create a calculator using S-Expr that compiles to ISL
    - Assume only +, *, -, / and all of the atoms are numbers

## 3 Templates

### Parallel Traveral

Template:

### my-append

```scheme
;; my-append : {X} . [List-of X] [List-of X] -> [List-of X]

(check-expect (my-append '() (list 40 50)) (list 40 50))
(check-expect (my-append (list 40 50) '()) (list 40 50))
(check-expect (my-append (list 10 20 30) (list 40 50)) (list 10 20 30 40 50))
(check-expect (my-append (cons 10 (cons 20 (cons 30 '()))) (list 40 50)) (list 10 20 30 40 50))

(check-expect (cons 10 (my-append (cons 20 (cons 30 '())) (list 40 50))) (list 10 20 30 40 50))

(check-expect (cons 10 (cons 20 (my-append (cons 30 '()) (list 40 50)))) (list 10 20 30 40 50))

(check-expect (cons 10 (cons 20 (cons 30 (my-append '() (list 40 50))))) (list 10 20 30 40 50))
```

### add-pairs

```scheme
;; add-pairs : [List-of Number] [List-of Number] -> [List-of Number]
;; Constraints: the two lists have the same length.
(define (add-pairs alist blist)
  (cond
    [(and (empty? alist) (empty? blist)) '()]
    [(and (cons? alist) (cons? blist))
     (cons (+ (first alist) (first blist))
           (add-pairs (rest alist) (rest blist)))]))

(check-expect (add-pairs (list 10 20 30) (list 1 2 3)) (list 11 22 33))
(check-expect (add-pairs '() '()) '())
```

### list=?

```scheme
(define (list=? alist blist)
  (cond
    [(and (empty? alist) (empty? blist)) #true]
    [(and (cons? alist) (cons? blist))
     (and (= (first alist) (first blist))
          (list=? (rest alist) (rest blist)))]
    #;[(and (cons? alist) (cons? blist))

# Lecture 30 - Parallel and Black-Box Traversial

Recall the templates from Lecture 29.

### `my-append`

- black-box traversial (don't change `blist`. As opposed to parallel traversial)

```scheme
(define (my-append alist blist)
  (cond
    [(empty? alist) blist]
    [(cons? alist) (cons (first alist) (my-append (rest alist) blist))]))
```

But if `blist` doesn't change, how can we optimize this so it doesn't take in `blist`?

```scheme
;; my-append : {X} . [List-of X] [List-of X] -> [List-of X]
(define (my-append/v3 alist blist)
  (local (;; helper : [List-of X] -> [List-of X]
          [define (helper l)
            (cond
              [(empty? l) blist]
              [(cons? l) (cons (first l) (helper (rest l)))])])
    (helper alist)))
```

- Recursion can happen in a helper function as well

Challenge: use a list abstraction for the definition of `my-append`

```scheme
(define (my-append/v2 l1 l2)
  (foldr cons l2 l1))
```

### List-ref

`list-ref` - Returns the nth element of a list

```scheme
(list-ref (list 10 20 30) 0) ; Returns 10
```

- Natrual means positive integer that include 0

### `my-list-ref`

```scheme
;; my-list-ref : [List-of X] Nat -> X
(define (my-list-ref/v1 alist index)
  (if (= index 0)
      (first alist)
      (my-list-ref/v1 (rest alist) (- index 1))))
```

What are different ways of writing this function? Can we write this with parallel traversial?

```scheme
(define (my-list-ref/v2 alist index)
  (cond
    [(empty? alist) (error "invalid index")]
    [(and (cons? alist) (zero? index)) (first alist)]
    [(cons? alist) (my-list-ref/v2 (rest alist) (- index 1))]))
```

### `list=?`

Making a more general definition of `list=?` (because the previous definition only compared numbers)

- Combines both parallel traversial and black-box traversial

```scheme
;; list=? : {X} . (X X -> Boolean) [List-of X] [List-of X] -> Boolean
(define (list=? compare alist blist)
  (cond
    [(and (empty? alist) (empty? blist)) #true]
    [(and (cons? alist) (cons? blist))
     (and (compare (first alist) (first blist))
          (list=? compare (rest alist) (rest blist)))]
    [else #false]))
```

- You can also write this function using list abstractions

# Lecture 32 - Accumulators and Graphs

Material that is talked about on Monday and Wednesday is not going to be graded so he can talk about anything we want.

Things we are going to talk about next week

- Operating systems
- Machine learning

Grades will be back by (at least) Friday

One more assignment left

- Covers what are doing in class today

### Monday's Lecture

- Parallel traversial
- Graphs

## Accumulators

Return the list of sums of numbers up to a certain point in a list

Make a helper function

- lets forget about list abstractions

```scheme
;; sum-to : [List-of Number] -> [List-of Number]
(define (sum-to lon)
  (modified-sum-to 0 lon))

;; sum-so-far is the *accumulator*
(define (modified-sum-to sum-so-far lon)
  (cond
    [(empty? lon) '()]
    [(cons? lon)
     (local ([define new-sum-so-far (+ sum-so-far (first lon))])
       (cons new-sum-so-far
             (modified-sum-to new-sum-so-far (rest lon))))]))
```

**sum-so-far is the accumulator**

- Notice that adding a new argument would make things easier
    - And then you just initialize the accumulator to 0 in the main function

Challenge: solve-to using list template and no helper function

- This solution is more complicated and is less efficent

## Graphs (or network)

### Trees

- Cannot jump to different levels. Hierarchy

"If you can work with trees, your life is relatively easy" - Arjun

- Unlike trees, graphs can cycle back to any point
    - Ex. roads, social media, etc.
- **Directed Graphs**
    - Only one direction is viable
    - ex. Twitter - "I can choose to follow you, you don't have to follow me back"
- **Undirected Graphs**
    - Needs to be able to go both ways
    - ex. Facebook  - "Needs to be friends with each other"

**Edges** - Arrows between people

**Nodes** - The people themselves (or vertices)

**Neighbors** *-* Nodes that are immediately adjacent

### Turning this idea into code:

```scheme
(define-struct node [name neighbors])

;; A [Graph X] is a [List-of [Node X]]
;; A [Node X] is a (make-node X [List-of X])
;;
;; Interpretation: [Graph X] represents a graph, with nodes labelled X.
;;
;; For each node:
;;
;; 1. _(make-node x (list y-1 ... y-n))_, the graph has the edges from _x_ to
;;    _y-1_, ..., and from _x_ to _y-n_.
;;
;; 2. There must be nodes labelled _y-1_, ..., _y-n_ in the graph.
;;
;; Finally, all node labels must be unique.

;; [Graph String]

(define ex-social
  (list (make-node "Alice" (list "Bob" "Carol"))
        (make-node "Bob" (list  "Carol" "David"))
        (make-node "Carol" (list "Emma" "David"))
        (make-node "David" (list "Frank"))
        (make-node "Emma" (list "Alice"))
        (make-node "Frank" '())))
```

- This isn't as easy as trees because a subsection of a graph is not just a part of the bigger tree (think recursion)

- This question about getting paths from graphs is very common in computer science

- Keep an accumulator of the neighbors that we have already been to

```scheme
(define-struct person [name mother father])
;; A FamilyTree is a:
;; - (make-person String Person Person)
;; - #false

(define ex-ft (make-person "Alice"
                           (make-person "Bob" #false #false)
                           (make-person "Carol"
                                        (make-person "David" #false #false)
                                        #false)))

;; neighbors-of : [Graph String] String -> [List-of String]
(define (neighbors-of g name)
  (cond
    [(empty? g) (error "not a node")]
    [(cons? g) (if (string=? name (node-name (first g)))
                   (node-neighbors (first g))
                   (neighbors-of (rest g) name))]))


;; path? : [List-of X] [Graph X] X X -> Boolean
(define (path-helper visited g src dst)
  (cond
    ;[(member? src visited) #false]
    [(member? dst (neighbors-of g src)) #true]
    [else
     (ormap
      (lambda (src-neighbor)
        (path-helper (cons src visited) g src-neighbor dst))
      (neighbors-of g src))]))

;; path? : [Graph X] X X -> Boolean
(define (path? g src dst)
  (path-helper '() g src dst))

# Lecture 33 - Accumulators

Exam will be returned tomorrow morning

NOTE: Graphs are prime Software Engineer interview questions

- Accumulators won't run out of memory like recursion will because it sends the completed (up to said point) value through again. In recursion it opens all of the stacks and then runs the functions.

## Reverse

Problem: design a funciton to reverse a list.

```scheme
;; Problem: design a function reverse a list.
;; reverse : {X} [List-of X] -> [List-of X]
(define (my-reverse alist)
  (cond
    [(empty? alist) '()]
    [(cons? alist)
     (append
      (my-reverse (rest alist))
      (list (first alist)))]))

;(check-expect (my-reverse (list 10 20 30 40)) (list 40 30 20 10))

(define (my-reverse/v2 alist)
  (reverse-helper alist '()))

;(check-expect (my-reverse/v2 (list 10 20 30 40)) (list 40 30 20 10))

;(my-reverse/v2 (list 10 20 30 40))
#|
(reverse-helper (list 10 20 30 40) ???)
..
..
..
(reverse-helper (cons 40 '()) (list 30 20 10))
=> (cons 40 (list 30 20 10))
(reverse-helper '() (list 40 30 20 10))
|#

;; reverse-helper : {X} [List X] [List X] -> [List X]
(define (reverse-helper alist reversed-so-far)
  (cond
    [(empty? alist) reversed-so-far]
    [(cons? alist)
     (reverse-helper (rest alist)
                     ; Use (first alist)
                     (cons (first alist) reversed-so-far))]))
#|
(my-reverse/v2 (list 10 20 30 40))
(rh (cons 10 (cons 20 (cons 30 (cons 40 '())))) '())
(rh (cons 20 (cons 30 (cons 40 '()))) (cons 10 '()))
(rh (cons 30 (cons 40 '())) (cons 20 (cons 10 '())))
|#

(define (my-reverse/v3 alist)
  (local ([define (reverse-helper alist reversed-so-far)
            (cond
              [(empty? alist) reversed-so-far]
              [(cons? alist)
               (reverse-helper (rest alist)
                               ; Use (first alist)
                               (cons (first alist) reversed-so-far))])])
    (reverse-helper alist '())))
```

- Remeber, we can make these helper functions local (this is an acceptable use of local)

## Foldl

```scheme
;; my-foldr : {X Y} (X Y -> Y) Y [List-of X] -> Y
(define (my-foldr f base alist)
  (cond
    [(empty? alist) base]
    [(cons? alist) (f (first alist) (my-foldr f base (rest alist)))]))

;; my-foldl : {X Y} (X Y -> Y) Y [List-of X] -> Y
(define (my-foldl f accum alist)
  (cond
    [(empty? alist) accum]
    [(cons? alist)
     (my-foldl f (f (first alist) accum) (rest alist))]))

(define (my-reverse/v4 alist)
  (my-foldl cons '() alist))

;; (my-foldr f base (cons a (cons b (cons c '()))))
;; => (f a (f b (f c base)))

;; (my-foldl f accum (cons a (cons b (cons c '()))))

# Lecture 34 - Accumulators Generative Recursion

Exam grades will be released this evening.

- Average score was about 70 points (which is about 5 points lower than usual) â€” this hasn't been a normal semester

Get involved with research and stuff!

## Accumulators

### Tree Example

```scheme
(define-struct leaf [])
(define-struct node [left value right])
;; A [BT X] is one of:
;; - (make-leaf)
;; - (make-node BT X BT)

(define ex-bt-1
  (make-node (make-node (make-leaf) 10 (make-leaf)) 20 (make-leaf)))
;; flatten-bt : {X} [BT X] -> [List-of X]
(define (flatten-bt abt)
  (cond
    [(leaf? abt) '()]
    [(node? abt) (append (flatten-bt (node-left abt))
                         (list (node-value abt))
                         (flatten-bt (node-right abt)))]))

(check-expect (flatten-bt ex-bt-1) '(10 20))
```

- But this is slow
- We can use an accumulator for this:

```scheme
;; flatten-bt-helper : {X} [BT X] [List-of X] -> [List-of X]
(define (flatten-bt-helper abt acc)
  (cond
    [(leaf? abt) acc]
    [(node? abt)
     (local ([define new-acc (flatten-bt-helper (node-right abt) acc)])
       (flatten-bt-helper (node-left abt)
                          (cons (node-value abt) new-acc)))]))

;; flatten-bt/v2 : {X} [BT X] -> [List-of X]
(define (flatten-bt/v2 abt)
  (flatten-bt-helper abt '()))
```

## Generative Recursion

- we've usually been using structrual recursion

`apply` - Function that takes in a list and uses every element in a list as arguments to the function input
# Lecture 35 - Generative Recursion and Machine Learning

What we should read over break in preperation of Fundies 2

- Google northeastern Fundies 2 (go over the lecture notes)
- Head First Java (book) is pretty good
- Online course?
    - UCST Coursera course

Concluding regular programming today

Then random stuff

- Gradient decent

< No code posted :( >

## Generative Recursion

Recall new line function (see Lecture 34 for more)

- Notice: it didn't follow the design recipe

### Insertion Sort

<slc - `sort<` >

### Quick Sort (or at least the essense of Quick Sort)

<slc - qsort>

## Intro To Machine Learning

"Bascially all machine learning is recursion problems" - Arjun

### Rate of Change

<slc - rate of change>

Note: change2 is the limit definition of the derivative

**Higher Order Function**: Any function that receives another function as an argument

"You are the derivative function" - Arjun

### Linear Regression

Essentially, can we make a linear function that acts as a line of best fit for a list of points?

### Gradient Descent

"The linear formula is y=mx+b. I'm going to massage this a little bit" - Arjun

Gradient is just a fancy term for slope.

Guess the slope and then guess the y-intercept

(F 5) â‡’ 53

(F 3) â‡’ 33

What is the function?

We need to guess the slope first. If you get lucky and guess 10 and 3 for the slope and y-intercept respectively you get the following:

((linear 5) 10 3) â‡’ 53

((linear 3) 10 3) â‡’ 33

**How can we do better than just blind guessing?**

How much should you vary between guesses?

(deriv (lambda (slope) (- (F 5) ((linear 5) slope 3))) 7 0.0001) â‡’ ~5.0000

- This shows how much you jump
# Lecture 36 - Continued Machine Learning

"I'm closing my door because my cat is dying" - Arjun

Recall code from yesterday

Intro to 3D graphing

By using a 3D graph, we can better represent changing both `m` and `b` in the function `y=m*x+b` (recall that we already know `x`)

```scheme
(require plot)

(define ex-linear (Î» (x) (+ (* 2 x) -2)))

;; linear-at : Num -> (Num Num -> Num)
;; Represents _y = mx + b_. But with two tricks:
;; - _x_, _m_ and _b_ are all parameters
;; - The function first receives _x_ and produces a function that receives _m_ and _b_
(define linear-at
  (lambda (x)
    (lambda (m b)
      (+ (* m x) b))))

;; A plot of the two-argument function:
;;
;; f(x,y) = 2xy + x^2 + 3y
;;
;; Evaluate (plot3d ex-3d-plot)
(define (show-3d-plot-1)
  (plot3d (surface3d (Î» (x y) (+ (* 2 x y) (* x x) (+ 3 y))) -1 1 -1 1)))
```

NOTE: You can't get the derivative of absolute value which is why we square to get the 'error'

- Term for the 'error' is L2-norm

The particular algorithm is called Gradient Descent

- Socastic Gradient Descent is what's used in practice (we are ignoring the extra features)

### How to solve it:

1. We need to detremine what our model is going to be
    1. The example that we've used has just been linear models
2. Need data (called training data)
3. Calculate the error (called the loss)
    1. Often times an error of 0 is not possible
4. If the loss is acceptable, return current parameters
5. If the loss is not acceptable, pick new values for the parameters. Goal is to go "down the slope"

NOTE: When actually doing this, we don't actually build the curve. We use the derivative to move down the slope

```scheme
; Cannot get to zero error on this example:
; (plot-linear-error '(1 2 3) '(-2 5 -10))

;; High-level idea:
;;
;; 1. Assume we have x-values and y-values (the *training data*)
;; 2. Guess values for m and b (the *parameters* of the model)
;; 3. Calculate the error (the *loss*)
;; 4. Is the loss acceptable? Return the current parameters
;; 5. Pick new values the parameters. Goal is to go "down the slope", i.e., negative of the derivate
;; 6.
```

We need to derive the function with respect to multiple variables (the example that we've used is `m` and `b`)

### Partial Derivative

Consider one of the variables to be a constant.

For this example, we are just going to use a numeric derivative (with a small episilon). Essentially, we move slightly in different directions and see how quickly the output changes

```scheme
;; Partial Derivatives

;; How precise do we want our numeric derivates to me?
(define EPSILON 0.00001)

;; map-index: {X Y} (Nat X -> Y) [List-of X] -> [List-of Y]
;; Similar to map, but also gives the position of the element to _f_.
(define (map/index f alist)
  (local (;; map-index/helper : Nat [List-of X] -> [List-of Y]
          [define (map/index-helper index alist)
            (cond
              [(empty? alist) '()]
              [else (cons (f index (first alist)) (map/index-helper (+ 1 index) (rest alist)))])])
    (map/index-helper 0 alist)))

;; partial-deriv : (Num ... -> Num) [List-of Num] -> [List-of Num]
;; Given an _n_ argument function, and an argument list, calculates its _n_ partial derivates.
(define (partial-derivs F params)
  (build-list
   (length params) ;; For every parameter to F
   (Î» (n)
     (local (;; Add epsilon to the nth parameter, and leave the others unchanged.
             [define params+epsilon
               (map/index
                (Î» (i p) (if (= i n) (+ EPSILON p) p))
                params)])
       ;; We receive a list of parameters for F.
       (/ (- (apply F params+epsilon) (apply F params)) EPSILON)))))
```
