    <p>Choose any two short stories from the selections I‚Äôve uploaded to
  Canvas. Alternatively, I would approve another short story selection
  from one of the authors I‚Äôve included (Vonnegut, Butler, Nemisin) if you talk to me first.</p>

    <p>Give a general comparison of the two pieces you‚Äôve read. What
  standsout out to you thematically in each piece? What lesson, or moral,
  does each text offer? Try and describe the ideals, ethics, or sense of
  morality the story deploys so that you (the reader) can tell right from
  wrong in the context of these speculative fictions. Feel free to quote
  directly from the readings if that helps you explain your ideas.</p>

      <li>‚ÄúThe music began again and was much improved‚Äù (pg. 13)

timely discussion of your subject?</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>A basic definition or contextual background to introduce the group to
your reader, who might be completely unfamiliar with the subject. [still try and make this dramatic]</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>A representative image of this community (crowd of members). Describe the picture in detail as if your reader can not see the image. What is important in this image and why? What small details should the reader notice as important?</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>A dramatic scene that represents the subject‚Äôs dominate impression, or essential characteristics.</p>

  </li>
  <li>Needs a dominate impression
