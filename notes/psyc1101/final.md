### What is projective testing?

### What are the tenets of "trait theory?" What are the "Big Five" traits? What is the most vexing problem for trait theory?

Uses description instead of explanation 

The Big Five are: REMEMBER CANOE
* Conscientiousness
* Agreeableness
* Neuroticism
* Openness
* Extraversion

The most vexing problem for trait theory is that they don't do a good job predicting isolated behavior, rather, they are only good predictors of averages.

### How does the social-cognitive perspective seek to address the shortcomings of trait theory?

Reciprocal determinism: a person's behavior both influences and is influenced by personal factors and social environment.

"The trait perspective of personality emphasizes the broad role of traits in outcome prediction, whereas the social-cognitive perspective emphasizes the importance of ifâ€”then intrapsychic associations." - sagepub

### How does the perception of control vs. helplessness affect wellbeing? What roles do things like self-concept, optimism, attributional style, and external assessment play in this dynamic?

External locus of control vs internal locus of control

* Internal vs external

Realism is also valuable.
