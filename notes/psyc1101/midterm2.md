Erikson's stages and their virtues




# Development

### What are the biological stages of development?

**Prenatal Development**:
* Zygote (Conception to 2 weeks)
* Embryo (2 to 9 weeks)
* Fetus (9 weeks to birth)

**Kohlberg**

0-9 years: preconventional morality (avoiding punishment)

9-Adolescence: Conventional morality (based on social norms)

Adolescence+: Post conventional morality (social norms may be wrong)

**Erikson**:

Infancy:
* Basic trust
* Virtue: Hope

Toddler:
* Autonomy
* Virtue: will

Preschooler:
* Competence
* Virtue: will

Elementary School:
* Virtue: Competence

Adolescence:
* Identity
* Virtue: Fidelity

Young Adults:
* Intimacy
* Virtue: Love

Middle Adult:
* Generativity
* Virtue: Care

Late Adulthood:
* Integrity
* Virtue: Wisdom

**Piaget**:

Sensorimotor (birth to 2 years):
* Develops your five senses

Preoperational (2 - 6/7):
* Represents things with words, but too young for mental operations
* Fails conservation
* Egocentrism
    * Fails the doll experiment that requires theory of mind

Concrete Operational (around 7 years old):
* Passes conservation
* Comprehend mathematical transformations

Formal Operational Stage (12 years)
* Abstract reasoning



### How do we know what infants understand?

What they look at novel things

### What are Piaget's developmental stages? What is wrong with them? What is right? And how did they influence other developmental psychologists?

| Stage                |  Age Range | Characteristics                                                                                       |
|----------------------|-----------:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sensorimotor         |  0-2 Years | Coordination of senses with motor responses. Object Permanence develops.                              |
| Preoperational       |  2-7 Years | Usage of correct   grammar and syntax. Complex ideas are difficult. Conservation is developed (cups). |
| Concrete Operational | 7-11 Years | Concepts attached to concrete situations.                                                             |

**Object Permanence**

Objects exist even when they aren't observed

Starts to form in about 3 months.

**Principles of Objects**

* Objects can't pass through other objects
* They don't change directions
* They don't fall upwards

These things won't surprise someone who is less than 3 months.

**Preoperational Mind**

The glass that's taller *always* has more liquid in it.
* A 7 year old will pass this test, but just a few years younger will fail

3 year old can use a model of a house to find an object in the real house
* A 2.5 year old cannot

Cannot understand the existence of other minds (*egocentric*)

*Theory of mind**: understanding that other people have minds as well.

**Concrete Operational Stage**

Around 6-7. Children can comprehend conversation and understand basic laws of physics and reasoning.

**Formal Operational Stage**

Reasoning becomes more abstract (around 12 years old)

**What they got wrong**:

The human does not develop in 'stages', it is more continuous than concrete.

**What they got right**:

The sequence of these events happens the same for everyone (even if the exact timing isn't consistent). Children are not just little grown ups. They do not have the mental capacity to intentionally upset you.

### What is attachment? How can parents encourage it? Do different parenting styles do better?

Physical contact with humans is important and without it, we develop life-long attachment issues

Secure attachment: results in exploring novel situations
* More trust
* Happier parents

Insecure attachment: fearful in novel situations
* Fearful
* More aggressive

Yes. Secure attachment is a result of contact rather than nature (or even nursing).

### What is special about about adolescence? Emerging adulthood? Adulthood?

The limbic system is fully developed in adolescence, however, the frontal lobe is not.

Categorizing adults is difficult and the stages aren't that clear.
* It matters more how far away you are from dying then how old you are

### What does psychology teach us about (successful) aging?

The best thing you can do for your brain health is help your physical health.

As we age, our brain slows down (from a decrease in melanin). Our frontal lobe is the first to go.

# Sensation and Perception

### What is the distinction between "sensation" and "perception"?

Sensation is the information received through your organs. Perceptions is how you interpret that information.

Sensation without perception is anesthesia. Perception without sensation is hallucinations and phantom limb feelings.

### What are thresholds? How does top-down processing affect them?

Thresholds measure when you can see a stimulus 75% of the time (because 50% would just be chance). Top-down processing is when your brain influences what you see. You go from most general towards more specific. 

### What is adaptation?

A consequence of adaptation is that (typically) stimuli that are unchanged go undetected.

### What are the biological mechanisms that underpin the various senses?

**Vision**

Rods (light)  
* Trichromatic (RGB) 

Cones (color)

Lens

Pupil

Iris

Cornea

Blind Spot

Fovea: point of central focus

**Audition**

**Tactician**

**Balance**

**Pain**

**Gustation (Taste)**

**Olfaction (Smell)**

### What is hypnotism? What is it good for? What are some hypotheses about how it works?

### What is perceptual organization and what are some of the Gestalists' organizing principals of visual perception?

### What is a critical period?

### What is a perceptual "set"?

# Learning and Memory

### What are four main categories of learning?

### What are the key elements of classical conditioning?

### What are the key elements of operant conditioning? How do different schedules of reinforcement control behavior?

### What is the role of cognition in associative learning?

### How does observational learning differ from associative learning?

### What defines a memory? What are the major classes of memory?

### What tools are available to improve memory?

### What limits memory?

### How do memories go wrong?

# Cognition

### What kind of tasks fall under the umbrella of "cognition"?

### What are concepts?

### What are heuristics? How do they serve us? How do they inhibit critical thinking?

### What is framing?

### What are the building blocks of language? What defines how those blocks are assembled into productive combinations?

### What is the role of language in thinking? Does this explain the differences in abilities between humans and animals?
