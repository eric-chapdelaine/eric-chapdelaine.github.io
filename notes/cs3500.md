# The Class

Everything will be on Canvas

Self-evals are worth about 2-3 percent (each) of your grade

Exam is on June 1 (in 3 weeks). Exam 2 is two weeks after Exam 1.

First 4 assignments are completed by yourself. The next four are with partners.

2 late days for the first 4 assignments. Another 2 late days for the rest.

We will work with Java until Exam 2. Then C/C++.

If you are going to read a book, read *Head First Design Patterns: A Brain-Friendly Guide*.

We will be learning design patterns, not Java concepts:
* Interfaces
* Abstract classes
* Inheritance
* Function Objects
* Avoiding Mutation
* Exceptions
* Bugs with aliasing
* Custom equal and hash code 
* Testing
    * 40% of the assignments is just testing
    * Write tests before you write your code. Just write down tests on paper (just to get ideas).

How do we write code so that we can introduce change (without having to modify the code)?

What we won't learn:
* IList (Recursion)
* Iterators
* Visitor Patterns
* Big O
* Algorithms
* Priority Queues
* Graphs, BFS, DFS
* etc.

## Topics

* How to write reusable and decoupled (flexible) software

* SOLID Principles
    * Do *NOT* modify code on the exams
    * Interfaces should have the bare minimum

| S | Single Responsibility                     |
| O | Open to extension, closed to modification |
| L | Liskov substitution                       |
| I | Interface segregation                     |
| D | Dependency inversion                      |


* We will see what Java techniques we can use to code according to these principles.

**Why learn SOLID and design patterns?**

* Introducing changes in software development is much easier (and more requested) than in other fields.
* Code gets long
* We don't understand the entire code base, or a large part of it.

Unlike other fields, the design process for software engineering is more like:
1. Cursory analysis
2. Completely wrong implementation
3. More cursory analysis
4. Wrong-headed design
5. Some implementation and testing
6. More analysis and re-design
7. More implementation and testing
8. Iterate, iterate, iterate
9. Deployment
10. Bug reports
11. Head scratching
12. Coffee
13. Temptation to rewrite from scratch

How do we break up code into individual classes that can interact with each other such that it will enable us to introduce change without having to modify the design extensively?

Other topics we will cover:
* Composition  
* Access modifiers, private, protected and public, in other words, information hiding
* Testing
* Class diagrams
* Efficiency
* Client perspective versus implementer perspective
* We try to avoid mutability

What to remember while in this class:
* Don't modify existing code that we give you
* Always introduce new functionality with an interface or by extending a new interface
* Avoid mutability
* Be careful with references
* Start early on assignments
* Make sure you read the Design Principles Master List on Canvas
* Make sure you read "How to write tests" on Canvas

# Review from Fundies 1 and Fundies 2

Citation of publications (either Books or Articles)

Consider the implementation in Racket:

```scheme
;; A Publication is one of:
;; -- (make-book String String String String Number)
;; -- (make-article String String String Number Number Number)
(define-struct book [title author publisher location year])
(define-struct article [title author journal volume issue year])

;; Examples:
(define rushdie.v1
        (make-book "Midnight's Children" "Salman Rushdie"
                   "Jonathan Cape" "London" 1980))
(define turing.v1
        (make-article "Computing machinery and intelligence"
                      "A. M. Turing" "Mind" 59 236 1950))
```

Then we can make our citation functions:

```scheme
;; cite-apa: Publication -> String
;; To format a publication for citation in APA style.
(define (cite-apa pub)
  (cond
    [(book? pub)
     (format "~a (~a). ~a. ~a: ~a."
             (book-author pub) (book-year pub) (book-title pub)
             (book-location pub) (book-publisher pub))]
    [(article? pub)
     (format "~a (~a). ~a. ~a, ~a(~a)."
             (article-author pub) (article-year pub) (article-title pub)
             (article-journal pub) (article-volume pub) (article-issue pub))]))

;; cite-mla: Publication -> String
;; To format a publication for citation in MLA style.
(define (cite-mla pub)
  (cond
    [(book? pub)
     (format "~a. ~a. ~a: ~a, ~a."
             (book-author pub) (book-title pub) (book-location pub)
             (book-publisher pub) (book-year pub))]
    [(article? pub)
     (format "~a. \"~a.\" ~a ~a.~a (~a)."
             (article-author pub) (article-title pub) (article-journal pub)
             (article-volume pub) (article-issue pub) (article-year pub))]))

```

In an OO approach, the data would know how to cite itself. But in functional languages, we give the data to the function.

Now, what if we want to have a new publication: a webpage. How can we do this?

```scheme
;; In APA function
 [(webpage? pub)
     (format "~a. Retrieved ~a, from ~a."
             (webpage-title pub) (webpage-retrieved pub) (webpage-url pub))]
             
;; In MLA function
[(webpage? pub)
    (format "\"~a.\" Web. ~a <~a>."
            (webpage-title pub) (webpage-retrieved pub) (webpage-url pub))]

```

In this, we need to modify the code. This is fine for now, because the change is small, but we usually want to avoid changing code because it can break things. Or sometimes, you won't have permission to change the code.

Lets do an OO approach (ie the object knows how to cite itself) in Racket. We want to make the publications lambdas.

```scheme
;; new-book: String String String String Number -> Publication
;; To construct a new book.
(define (new-book title author publisher location year)
  (lambda (style)
    (cond
      [(string=? style "apa")
       (format "~a (~a). ~a. ~a: ~a."
               author year title location publisher)]
      [(string=? style "mla")
       (format "~a. ~a. ~a: ~a, ~a."
               author title location publisher year)])))

;; Example:
(define rushdie.v2
        (new-book "Midnight's Children" "Salman Rushdie"
                  "Jonathan Cape" "London" 1980))
```

This is now how we cite:
```scheme
(check-expect
 (rushdie.v2 "apa")
 "Salman Rushdie (1980). Midnight's Children. London: Jonathan Cape.")
```

Now adding the webpage, we don't need to change the code. But if we were to add a new citation style, we would (so advantages and disadvantages).

How do we do this in Java?
* Unless stated otherwise, make everything `private final`. Remember, fields of objects (and the classes inner-workings) should be unknown.

```java
/**
 * Specifies operations for formatting citations from bibliographic data.
 */
public interface Publication {
  /**
   * Formats a citation in APA style.
   *
   * @return the formatted citation
   */
  String citeApa();

  /**
   * Formats a citation in MLA style.
   *
   * @return the formatted citation
   */
  String citeMla();
}
```

Book's implementation:
```java
/**
 * The {@code Book} class represents bibliographic information for books.
 */
public class Book implements Publication {
  private final String title, author, publisher, location;
  private final int year;
  
    /** Constructs a {@code Book} object.
   *
   * @param title     the title of the book
   * @param author    the author of the book
   * @param publisher the publisher of the book
   * @param location  the location of the publisher
   * @param year      the year of publication
   */
  public Book(String title, String author, String publisher,
              String location, int year)
  {
    this.title = title;
    this.author = author;
    this.publisher = publisher;
    this.location = location;
    this.year = year;
  }
  
    public String citeApa() {
    return author + " (" + year + "). " + title + ". "
             + location + ": " + publisher + ".";
  }

  public String citeMla() {
    return author + ". " + title + ". " + location + ": "
             + publisher + ", " + year + ".";
  }
}


```

The Article's implementation is similar as well.


## Testing (JUnit):

Example with Book implementation above:
```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class BookTest {
  Publication rushdie = new Book("Midnight's Children", "Salman Rushdie",
                                 "Jonathan Cape", "London", 1980);
  @Test
  public void testCiteApa() {
    assertEquals(
      "Salman Rushdie (1980). Midnight's Children. London: Jonathan Cape.",
      rushdie.citeApa());
  }

  @Test
  public void testCiteMla() {
    assertEquals(
      "Salman Rushdie. Midnight's Children. London: Jonathan Cape, 1980.",
      rushdie.citeMla());
  }

}
```

## Submitting Homework

Zip the `src` and `test` and submit the `.zip` in Handin.

## JavaDoc

Compiles into HTML so you can put your own HTML in the JavaDoc.

```java
/**
* formatHelper helps the format method to do XYZ
* @param start the index of the start of the format template
* @param end the index of the end of the format template
* @return some string.
*/
public String formatHelper(int start, int end) {
    return "";
}
```
