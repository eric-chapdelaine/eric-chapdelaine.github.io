  <p> Welcome to my personal website. I'm currently a second year Computer Science major at Northeastern.</p>
  <p> I love Computer Science. From elegant proofs of algorithms to the design of readable, scalable code, the field is fascinating. But I know it can also be daunting. That's why I've published <a href="/notes">my notes</a> for every class I've ever taken here. Accompanying videos of key concepts will be coming out shortly.</p>
  <p> Additionally, if you are struggling with  particular concept or would just like to chat, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:chapdelaine.e@northeastern.edu">chapdelaine.e@northeastern.edu</a>.</p>
  <p> All the best,<br> Eric </p>
